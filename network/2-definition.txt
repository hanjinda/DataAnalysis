10001	It is important to understand what congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is before the nature of 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency can be fully explained. CAH refers to any one of the many autosomal recessive illnesses that result from flaws in cortisol synthesis steps done by the adrenal glands. All of the types of CAH have either overproduction or malfunctioning of sex steroids. 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency is just one of the types of CAH and is a result of mutation in the gene called CYP11B1. This type is next only to 21-hydroxylase deficiency when it comes to its prevalence, comprising only 5-8% of the entire number of cases.
10002	11Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency also known as (11beta-HSD2) is one of the most common causes of retention of sodium and serious cases of hypertension. This happens when glucocorticoids are admitted to the mineralocorticosteroid receptors which are non-selective.
10003	17 Alpha hydroxylase deficiency syndrome is a very rare disorder of the genes (specifically on steroid biosynthesis) which causes reduced production of sex steroids and glucocorticoids while the mineralocorticoid precursors are observed to have increased synthesis. It is, therefore, an autosomal recessive condition. The absence or deficiency of 17 hydroxylase results into many sexual malformations and illnesses.
10004	The hormones estrogen and androgen play critical roles in the development of sexual organs. 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isozyme (17▀-HSD) acts as a catalyst between the biologically inactive and active types of hormones. Any deviation from this normal process results into various abnormal conditions.
10005	1p36 deletion syndrome also known as monosomy 1p36 is a disorder of the chromosomes in which chromosome 1 loses the end part of its short arm. This disorder was first depicted during the late 90's and the early parts of 2000's. FISH testing is often required to be able to confirm a diagnosis. This condition can occur as a 'pure' case or it can occur together with other imbalances of the chromosome.
10006	21-hydroxylase deficiency is also called as congenital adrenal hyperplasia and is a disorder that is often inherited. This disorder affects the adrenal glands which are located above the kidneys and these glands produce hormones that are responsible for regulating many important human body functions. The two hormones, cortisol and aldosterone, are produced by an enzyme called the 21-hydroxylase. Patients that have 21-hydroxylase deficiency lack the 21-hydroxylase enzyme which then affects the cholesterol conversion to aldosterone and cortisol. When the precursors of these two hormones are stored excessively in the adrenal glands, they are changed into androgens (which are male sex hormones). Whether the patient is male or female, growth development could be hampered because of this deficiency.
10007	The disorder known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is caused by the deficiency or deletion of a tiny piece of chromosome 22. This deletion happens near the midsection of a chromosome located at q 11.2.
10008	3-Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency (3B HSD) is a very rare disorder of the genes involving steroid biosynthesis. This deficiency results into the decrease on the production of adrenal steroid groups which are inclusive of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and the sex steroids. A decrease on the secretion of mineralocorticoid would result into various salt wasting degrees in males and females. And for the 46 XY males, a deficiency in androgen would result into ambiguous genitals (the females are seen with enlarged clitoris).
10009	The enzyme called 3-Methyl Glutaconyl-CoA Hydratase is involved in amino acid (Leucine) metabolism. This enzyme is located in the mitochondria together with other enzymes of catabolic leucine. When an individual has a deficiency of 3-Methyl Glutaconyl-CoA Hydratase, 3-methylglutaconic acid is excreted massively and the impaired leucine breaks down. Very few patients have been reported with this type of deficiency but its occurrence is a reality, nonetheless. There a few severe clinical cases that have been reported which resulted because of this deficiency. Some patients have developed severe cardiopulmonary manifestations as soon as they were born; others have been reported to have psychomotor retardation; other cases include hypotonia, seizures, spasticity and thriving failure. Carnitine levels are at their lowest with this deficiency occurs. There are also rare cases of recurrent acidosis (seen in cases of fasting that has been prolonged). There was also a reported case of speech retardation.
10010	LCHAD or the long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase is one of the components of the trifunctional protein of mitochondria. When a person becomes deficient of LCHAD activity, he will soon show various manifestations of his inherited condition.
10011	3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency is known by many names. It is also called as 3MCC deficiency, Methylcrotonylglycinuria type 1, or BMCC. This is a disorder that can be inherited where the human body becomes incapable of properly processing some proteins. Those who suffer from this deficiency have an insufficient supply of leucine-breaking enzyme. Leucine is an amino acid which is a protein base.
10012	3-Methylglutaconic aciduria also known as MGA is a term that is used to depict at least 5 varying disorders which makes the body incapable of creating mitochondrial energy. Due to this impairment, 3-methylglutaric acid and 3-methylglutaconic acid create a buildup and their presence can be detected in the patient's urine. 3-Methylglutaconic acid, by classification, is an organic acid. The potency of this acid is made possible by the roles of the double carboxylic acids. The acid function makes the 3-methylglutaconic acid detectable.
10013	3C syndrome is also known as cranio-cerebello cardiac (CCC dysplasia) or Ritscher-Schinzel (named after Ritscher and Schinzel who discovered the illness) and is a very rare case of disease. This syndrome is characterized by heart defects or heart malformations and other symptoms that involve the brain. As of 2006, a Kuwaiti medical journal showed that only 30 cases have been reported worldwide and these cases were discovered in Europe and North America. Due to the limited number of cases reported, this disease was classified as a rare type of illness. The molecular basis for this syndrome is still unknown.
10014	3M syndrome is known by many names. It can also be called as Three M syndrome or dolicospondylic dysplasia; le Merrer syndrome or gloomy syndrome (because prevalent symptoms show malformities on the patients' faces). This is a very rare illness where only 32 patients have been reported to have acquired it. Its name originated from the names of the authors who first described the characteristics of the illness. The authors' names were Miller, J.D., Malvaux P. and the third is McKusick, V.A. No mental retardation has been mentioned as a result of 3M. This disorder is known as an autosomal recessive trait of the genes and can be inherited.
10015	46 Gonadal dysgenesis epibulbar dermoid can be best described as a female in her adolescent period that experiences no changes even during this age of puberty. This is because this disorder is a type of female hypogonadism. When this disorder is acquired, the ovaries do not develop and function to perform their duties. With this type of disorder, female patients experience a deficiency in their supply of estrogen while the LH and FSH levels are at their peak. It is advisable to give the patient hormonal treatments such as the introduction of estrogen and progesterone to the body.
10016	47 XXY syndrome is popularly known as the Klinefelter's syndrome, or simply, the XXY syndrome. Chromosome aneuploidy causes the occurrence of this condition. The male patients develop an extra X chromosome. Typically, males should have one each of the X and the Y chromosomes. Patients who suffer from this condition have smaller testicles when compared to their normal male counterparts and thus, they acquire problems on infertility. There are very few symptoms to this syndrome and the cases vary among boys and men. The term for this illness was named after an endocrinologist, Harry Klinefelter. 1942 was the year when he first described the XXY syndrome. The patients who suffer with XXY syndrome are called XXY males or 47,XXY males.
10017	The XYY syndrome should never be interchanged with the XXY syndrome which is popularly known as the Klinefelter's syndrome. XYY syndrome is a condition when a male patient acquires an extra Y chromosome in addition to the normal one X and one Y chromosomes. It is often argued whether the term 'syndrome' should be used in connection to the XYY condition since the patients' phenotypes are normal and they do not have knowledge of their karyotype.
10018	48 XXXX syndrome is a very rare disorder of the chromosomes where the normal XX combination becomes a quadruple X grouping. This condition is also called tetrasomy X, 48, XXXX or quadruple X and is only seen among females as there is no Y chromosome involved. The first occurrence of this disorder was discovered in 1961 and since then, there are about 100 reported cases globally.
10019	Previously known to be a variant or type of the Klinefelter's syndrome, this condition is an anomaly of the sex chromosome. The features usually include gynecomastia (having enlarged male breasts), ulcers of the skin, deformed craniofacial features, and being unusually tall. It is also believed to affect 1 in every 17,000 male babies that are born. XXYY is just one of the many variations of chromosomal defects which include the following: 47 xxy, xy, xxxxy, and xxxy; also the xyy. These syndromes affect males whereas female counterparts include the Turner syndrome and other varieties with added X chromosomes.
10020	The 49 XXXXX syndrome (also called as Penta X or pentasomy X) is a chromosomal condition that affects females. In a normal setup, females have only two X chromosomes and anything beyond this is abnormal. In the case of Penta X syndrome, there are an additional three X chromosomes which now totals five. The three additional X chromosomes are the ones that cause multiple problems. These extra X chromosomes are formed together with the two healthy chromosomes inside the nucleus of the human body cells.
10021	Aagenaes syndrome is a condition which is characterized by inborn hypoplasia of the lymph vessels. This eventually causes recurring cholestasis on the formative years lymphedema on the legs. This could develop into hepatic cirrhosis and giant cell hepatitis (which could occur with portal tract fibrosis). The name of Aagenaes syndrome was derived from a pediatrician in Norway named Oystein Aagenaes. The name was finalized in 1968 when the condition was first described by Aagenaes. It is sometimes called cholestasis-lymphedema syndrome or simply CLS.
10022	Aarskog Ose Pande syndrome is a rare type of medical disorder where the main symptoms include lipodystrophy on the buttocks and face. Since this is an adipose tissue defect, the loss of body fat in the body could get severe and this state could progress extensively. There are three kinds of lipodystrophy: localized lipodystrophy, partial lipodystrophy and total lipodystrophy. One other symptom is Rieger anomaly. This anomaly is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of teeth (it could also mean the delay of tooth eruption) and some abnormalities of the eyes and face. Having sparse hair is also a common sign. This does not only mean hair on one's head but also body hairs. Other defects include retardation of bone age and abnormal motion of the joints (which could eventually lead to dislocation). This syndrome could begin to affect the patient as early as the fetal stage. It could ruin the growth of the fetus in the uterus by slowing its development. When this happens, many other systems are affected. Development of the patient's skills on speech could also be delayed when this disorder is acquired. This and all other symptoms are similar to characteristics of many other diseases that is why the physician should perform a thorough checkup of the patient to be able to diagnose the real condition. Aarskog Ose Pande syndrome is also considered as a variant of Short syndrome. This symptom does not only mean having a short stature but also having low weight at birth and fat losses on the skin.
10023	Aarskog syndrome is an inherited disorder that is often characterized by abnormalities of the face, short stature, genital abnormalities and mucoloskeletal anomalies.
10024	Aase Smith syndrome also known as Aase syndrome is a very rare disorder that can be inherited. It is often characterized by skeletal and joint defects. Aase syndrome is known as an autosomal dominant condition. The genetic origin of the illness is still not known. Anemia which results from this syndrome is often caused by the underdevelopment of bone marrows. These bone marrows are where formation of blood cells takes place. The syndrome was named after two pediatricians who were David Weyhe Smith and Jon Morton Aase.
10025	Aase syndrome is a rare congenital defect characterized by anemia accompanied with certain skeletal deformities.
10026	Aaviophobia is a fear of being on a plane while in flight. Other names include aviatophobia, aerophobia, and pteromerhanophobia. The condition is considered more of a symptom rather than a disease. When fear of flying reaches a level that can significantly interfere with a person's ability to travel by plane, it will then be classified as fear of flying.
10027	Abasia is a condition where the patient is unable to walk due to impaired muscle synchronization. This means that the patient lacks motor synchronization in walking. With this condition, the foundation of gait (this is the distance of the two feet when measured sideways) is not constant or cannot be measured. This often leads the patient to sway from side to side or in any other direction, nearly falls, only to recover in the end. There are many other medical conditions that are connected to this disorder: choreic abasia (brought about by chorea of the leg); paralytic abasia (this is a paralysis of the muscles in the legs); spastic abasia (a condition where the leg muscles stiffen because they do not coordinate properly); ataxic abasia (legs become ataxic); paroxysmal trepidant abasia (a condition where the legs become spastic); trembling abasia (by its name, it means trembling legs). Abasia often comes with astasis (this is the state of being unable to stand). This condition is also referred to as astasia-abasia.
10028	Abdominal aortic aneurysm can be diagnosed on anyone but the most viable candidates are men aged over 60. Couple this range of age with some of the common risk factors and the patient is on his way to developing this condition. This disorder happens when a blood vessel enlarges abnormally or causes a protrusion. The abdominal aorta, which is a huge blood vessel, is the one responsible in supplying blood to the abdomen, the legs and the pelvic area. When this abdominal aortic aneurysm raptures, is truly becomes life-threatening and should be attended to immediately.
10029	Cystic lymphangioma is a very rare tumor (comprises just about 6% of tumors that are benign in children) which is often located in the axillary or cervical regions. Sometimes, there are exceptional cases where it is situated in the abdomen. When it is situated in the abdomen, it becomes a rare type of benign tumor which often appears in infants and some children under the age of 5. Boys are more vulnerable to this disease. Abdominal cystic lymphangioma happens when there is an inborn defect in the link of central connecting structure and the primary lymphatic channel. This manifests in abdominal tumors which could occur even without any compression from structures that are adjacent to that part. When clinically tested, these cysts appear as pseudo appendices or pseudo-ascites syndrome.
10030	Defects of the abdominal wall are comparatively common fetal abnormalities. It occurs in about 1 in every 2,000 births. Majority of these defects of the abdominal wall cannot be detected early on in pregnancy. When a defect is detected, it is necessary to pinpoint what type of defect it is so that proper medication and treatments can be done. There are many types of abdominal wall disorders. Some examples include: gastroschisis, omphalocele, esophageal atresia, and duodenal atresia.
10031	Abdominal migraine is a kind of migraine commonly experienced by children. It is characterized by abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea. These migraines are thought to be present in the child's family members as well.
10032	Abdominal pain is is a medical condition that is characterized by the occurrence of the pain felt in the abdomen.
10033	Abercrombie syndrome, also known as amyloid degeneration, is a progressive decay of the organ tissues due to the excessive amyloid infiltration that eats up the tissue fibers. It is sometimes known as waxy degeneration.
10034	Aberrant subclavian artery is also known as the aberrant subclavian artery syndrome. This condition is a rare anatomical variety of the source of the left or the right subclavian artery. This abnormality has the most number of cases when it comes to the anomaly of inborn vascular aortic arch. The aberrant artery commonly occurs just distal on the left portion of the subclavian artery. It then passes later to the mediastinum when it is on its way to the upper right extremities. This course may be the root cause of a vascular ring about the mediastinal makeup.
10035	Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare hereditary disorder that hinders regular absorption of fact from digested food. Patients with the disease lack the vitamins A, D, E and K.
10036	Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome or AMS is a very uncommon genetic disorder that can be inherited. This syndrome is characterized by various physical defects which usually affect areas of the face, fingers, skin, and the genitalia (penis symptoms and some defects on the testes). Patients of AMS could also have other malformations on their abdominal walls or on their nipples. Other traits include having underdeveloped eyelids (or Ablepharon); the absence of eyebrows and eyelashes; mouths that look like that of a fish's (also known as Macrostomia); cracked skin; ears that appear to be low-set (also known as pinnae). The eye defects could appear due to ablepharon. Some people with AMS could also have very thin or sparse hair (alopecia); their skin appears to be wrinkled, dry, coarse, or thick; their fingers could also be webbed and with inadequate extension; the genitalia could have external malformations. In very few cases of Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome, the patient could have little or no nipples at all (having small nipples is known as hypoplastic nipples). One of the worst characteristics could be the protrusion of some parts of the large intestine through a dilated portion of the abdominal wall (this condition is called ventral or abdominal hernia). Infants and children who suffer from AMS may have some delays on the development of their language skills. Some of them may manifest signs of mild retardation of the mind while others may grow up to be normal. A disorder that appears to have the same features as Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome is the Barber-say syndrome. The latter is characterized by laxity of the skin; ablepharon; hypertelorism, macrostomia, telecanthus, acute hirsutism, and helix agenesis of the pair of ears. Less common signs of AMS include undescended testes and hernia on the umbilicus.
10037	Abnormal uterine bleeding refers to the excessive flow of blood during menstruation. The common symptoms of this condition are a massive menstrual discharge accompanied by pain in the lower abdomen.
10038	Abscess is a collection of pus or dead neutrophils that has mount up in a cavity made by the tissue on the basis of an infectious process or other foreign materials.
10039	Abscess, bartholin (Bartholin's abscess) is characterized by the accumulation of pus that results in the formation of a lump or swelling in one of the Batholin glands, which are located on each side of the vaginal opening.
10040	Absence seizure is more commonly known as the petit mal seizure that involves some a brief episodes or some sudden lapse of conscious activity. This occurs most often in children. Absence seizure may often look like the individual is only staring into space for a several seconds. This means in comparison to the regular epileptic seizures, the petit mal is very mild. However, some people may suffer from hundreds of episodes a day, which interrupts ordinary activities.
10041	The deficiency or absence of T lymphocytes is a rare immuno-deficiency condition which is characterized by the lack of CD8(+) T lymphocytes and the absence or depression of the function of the T cell. A mutation of the gene for ZAP-70 (tyrosine kinase which has notable effects on indicating through the T cell receptor) has been associated with this syndrome. T cells are cells that belong to a cluster of white blood cells which are known as the lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are responsible in cell-mediated immunity. They are distinguished from the other types of lymphocytes (the NK cells and the B cells) through the presence of a specific receptor on the surface of these cells. This receptor is called as T cell receptor or the TCR. The T abbreviation in T cell refers to thymus which is the primary organ in the development of the T cell.
10042	The Abt-Letterer-Siwe disease is a rare but rapidly progressive form of hystiocytosis. This condition is brought about by excessively high levels of hystiocytesin the bone marrow. This disease is difficult to treat, and is associated with diabetes insipidius.
10043	Acanthamoeba refers to the microscopic and free-living ameba that is relatively found to be quite common in the environment. This ameba can cause a number of infections that affects human beings called acanthamoeba infection.
10044	Acanthocheilonemiasis is an uncommon tropical infectious illness which is caused by Acanthocheilonema perstans, a parasite. This parasite causes rashes of the skin, chest and abdominal pains, joint and muscle pains, lumps on the skin and also neurologic defects. This disease is often transmitted when small flies bite the victim and the bite has the parasite with it. The scientific name of the fly that transmits the 'infectious bite' is A.Coliroides. Studies manifest that the white blood cell levels at elevated when the parasite is present in the human body. Acanthocheilonemiasis belongs to the parasitic diseases group which is called nematode or filarial diseases. This disease is often found in Africa only because the parasite is found abundantly on this region. Uganda, specifically, has had a lot of reported cases. A handful of patients were found in South America. Other names for this disease are Acanthocheilonemiasis perstans, Dipetalonema perstans, Mansonella perstans, and Dipetalonemiasis.
10045	Acanthocheilonemiasis perstans is a tropical contagious illness characterized by purities, pain in the chest and abdomen an enlarged spleen. This is a rare disease caused by the bit of flies known as A. coliroides that can be found in Africa. The disease can be treated by antibiotics and is diagnosed by laboratory tests showing elevated amounts of white blood cells.
10046	Acanthocytosis is a phenotype of the red cell which can be found in different fundamental conditions. Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome or Abetalipoproteinemia; and an acute disease of the liver (spur cell hemolytic anemia) are the most common conditions that can be associated with acanthocytosis. Acantha is a Greek word for thorn and it is fitting that it is given to name the spur cells that have projections of different sizes which are the acanthocytes. These cells appear to be contracted, irregular, and dense. The formation of these cells depends on the alteration of the fat composition and the fluidity of red cell's membrane.
10047	The mean age of the start of chorea-acanthocystosis or ChAc is approximately at age 35. There are a few cases, though, where it can occur as early as the initial decade or it can be as late as the 70th year of life. It runs a persistent progressive course and it may end up as a major disability in just a few years. Some patients become dependent on wheelchairs or become bedridden just on the third decade. It is certain that the individual's life expectancy will be reduced; there are even cases of unexplained or sudden deaths when the patient goes through an epileptic seizure. The range of the patients' ages at death is at 28-61 years.
10048	Acanthocytosis-Neurologic disorder, also known as neuroacanthocytosis, is a rare automsomal recessive disorder. This disease is characterized by muscle degeneration due to uncontrolled muscle movements and dysfunctional red blood cells. This disease usually begins during early adulthood.
10049	Acanthosis Nigricans is a dermatological condition where the skin appears to be brown to black in color. It also appears to be poorly defined, often velvety and is considered to be a state of hyperpigmentation. This is usually present in the lateral and posterior folds of the groin, the neck, the axilla, the umbilicus, and also some other areas. The changes on the skin's pigment are the sole signs of acanthosis nigricans. It can be noticed that it appears very slowly (sometimes it can take months or years). It is very rare that the affected areas may itch. This condition can begin at any age but it is more evident among darker-skinned individuals.
10050	Acanthotic nevus is an alternate name for seborrheic keratosis. It is a rare skin disease that consists of discolored lesions that appear to be oily. Since these lesions seem to be stuck on the epidermis, they are sometimes mistaken for cancerous growths. Acanthotic nevus develops usually on people who are above the age of 40. Among the symptoms of this disease is itching, swelling of lesions as well as irritability. Surgical treatment may be needed to remove the lesions.
10051	Accessory pancreas is a medical condition that is rare and in which there are little clusters of pancreatic cells that are distinct from the pancreas. This condition could occur in the mesentery of small intestines, duodenal walls, the upper portion of the jejunum or, in its rarest form-in the stomach walls, spleen, ileum or gallbladder. Accessory pancreas was first observed and described in 1859 by Klob.
10052	Accutane embryopathy is a set of congenital defects incurred by an infant due to the mother's intake of the drug accutane. An infant with accutane embryopathy is borne with malformations in the face and internal organs and abnormalities in the central nervous system. Pregnant women are likewise advised not to take accutane during pregnancy, and as well consume vitamin A-rich foods to maintain healthy skin.
10053	Achalasia also called esophageal achalasia; cardiospasm, achalasia cardiae; dyssynergia esophagus or esophageal aperistalsis; is an esophageal motility disease. This disorder manifests an impaired peristalsis of the smooth muscle level of the esophagus. Peristalsis is the term used to describe the muscular capability of the esophagus to make the food move down to the stomach). Also, a patient with achalasia has a lower esophageal sphincter or LES that cannot relax which is its normal response to swallowing. The most common form of this disorder is primary achalasia. This form has no recorded underlying cause. Esophageal cancer (Chagas disease in South America) could be a result of achalasia.
10054	The Achard Thiers syndrome, also called the Diabetic Bearded Woman syndrome or diabete des femmes a barbe, is a rare disease which occurs commonly among women who are in their postmenopausal stage. Its name was derived from the combination of the names of Joseph Thiers and Emile Achard. This is characterized by insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes mellitus (an example is glucosuria) and also indications of excess in androgen. This syndrome has the combined features of Cushing syndrome and Adrenogenital syndrome. It is a form of virilizing disease which is adrenocortical in origin. And since androgen is excessive on this disease, the common manifestations are masculinization (the voice pitch is lowered) and menstrual disorders (the menstrual flow can be sparse or non-existent). There are also cases of growth of 'manly hair' all over the body. The most common complication of this disorder is hirsutism.
10055	Acheiropodia is a disorder that is autosomal recessive in nature and which results into hemimelia (or the lack of distal extremities formation). This is an inborn defect consisting of aplasia of the patient's feet and hands and also distal lower and upper extremities bilateral amputations. This disease is found almost solely in Brazil. Other terms for this disorder include Acheiropody, Horn Kolb syndrome and Aleijadinhos (the Brazilian kind).
10056	Achilles Tendinitis is inflammation ans irritation of the Achilles tendon usually resulting due to sudden increase in the intensity or frequency of exercise.
10057	The Achilles tendon rupture is the damage of the large and fibrous cord that naturally connects the lower leg to the heel bone. The person may initially hear a snap followed by a sharp pain at the back of the ankle as well as in the lower leg. Such injuries may be improved with home treatment. However, more often than not, a surgical repair is required.
10058	Acholuric jaundice is a form of jaundice in which there is no bile in the urine. This is hereditary disorder in which bililrubin was not able to produce bile pigments causing now yellowish color on the organs and the skin.
10059	Marco Fraccaro was the very first person to observe and record the description of achondrogenesis in the year 1952. Fraccaro used this name in description of a stillborn female who was afflicted with acute micromelia and apparent changes on her histological cartilage. This term was then coined to characterize many more acute kinds of chondrodysplasia among humans. The conditions were invariably lethal on pre and post births. When the 70's came, researchers have concluded that the disorder is a part of a heterogenous cluster of chondrodysplasias that are fatal to neonates. Histological and radiological measures have distinguished the achondrogenesis type 1 (which is the Fraccaro-Houston-Harris kind) and the type 2 (or the Langer-Saldino kind). 1983 marked a new radiological category of the disease (Types 1-4). This was done by Gorlin and Whitley and was adapted by the McKusick catalog. This classification describes types 1 and 2 as having similar femoral cylinder indeces (or Clfemur which is calculated as the length of the femur bone divided by the range of the width of the same bone. Both kinds have stellate elongated bones and crenated ilia. Both types 1 and 2 are characterized by several rib fractures. Type 3 has ribs that are non-fractured, mushroom-stemmed elongated bones, halberd ilia, and a Clfemur 2.8 to 4.9. The last type (type 4) has sculpted ilia, long bones that are well-developed, non-fractured ribs and Clfemur measured at 4.9 to 8.0. The late 80's was the time when mutations on the collagen II structure were depicted to cause achondrogenesis type 3 (which might also correspond to type 2). At present, only 3 variants of the disorder have been identified and they are type IA or the Houston-Harris type; type IB (or the Parenti-Fraccaro type); and type II (or the Langer-Saldino type).
10060	Achondroplasia is a kind of autosomal disorder of the dominant genes which commonly causes dwarfism. Achondroplastic dwarfs are short in stature and their average height when they reach adulthood is at 123 centimeters (about 4 feet and 0.6 inches) for females and 131 centimeters (about 4 feet and 3.8 inches) for males.
10061	Achondroplastic Dwarfism is a medical condition characterized by the occurrence of the disturbance of the growth of the bones.
10062	Achromatopsia or ACHM is a condition where the patient is unable to perceive color. Although this name may also be used to refer to acquired defects such as cerebral achromatopsia or color agnosia, it normally refers to a congenital disorder of the vision which is autosomal recessive in nature. It can also be called rod monochromacy or total inborn color blindness. Patients with this kind of disorder manifest total absence of the cone cell activity through electroretinography. At least 4 causes are listed as congenital ACHM: ACHM2 and ACHM3; the third type is a cone photoreceptor transducin called GNAT2, ACHM4; the last cause is still unknown.
10063	Acid Beta-glucosidase deficiency is a rare genetic biochemical defect characterized by the lack of glucocerebrosidase enzyme in the body. This is usually presented by a greater tendency to form bruises, fatigue, femoral head necrosis and an enlarged abdomen. It is sometimes called Gaucher's disease.
10064	Acid Ceramidase deficiency, also known as Farber's disease, is a rare infantile disease that is characterized by multiple ceramide containing nodules underneath the skin. These nodules can cause swelling in the abdominal area, painful swelling of arteries and psychomotor retardation. No specific treatment is yet discovered to treat the disease.
10065	Acid maltase deficiency or AMD is a type of autosomal recessive disorder which is characterized by an extreme buildup of glycogen contained by vacuoles (in almost all cell types) that are lysosome-derived. Quantities of free extralysosomal glycogen that are in excess have also been depicted. AMD was first observed and described by JC Pompe in 1932 at Amsterdam. He reported a case of a baby girl, aged 7 months, who became chronically ill from what they believed to be pneumonia. The autopsy that was done later showed an uncommonly engorged heart but with normal valves. This condition was called cardiomegalia glycogenica diffusa by Pompe. He considered it as a disorder that is analogous to the von Gierke syndrome. This very first article was soon followed by reports that seemed similar. The two other authors described the children as afflicted with cardiomegaly and acute muscle weakness. They died in their early infancy. Their disease was linked to an excess in the deposition of glycogen in numerous tissues. This disorder was then named the Pompe disease and by the year 1957, it was typified as type 2 glycogenosis by GT Cori.
10066	Acid reflux is a result of the inflammation of the esophagus due to the presence of gastric acid coming from the stomach. It is commonly known as heartburn. Acid reflux can be treated by weight loss management and medications that help reduce gastric acid production, as well as surgical procedures.
10067	Isovaleric Acidemia or isovaleric aciduria is an autosomal metabolic illness which prevents or disturbs the normal metabolism of branched-chain amino acid leucine. It is a traditional form of organic academia.
10068	Propionic acidemia also known as propionic aciduria or ketotic glycinemia is an uncommon metabolic disorder which is characterized by the deficiency of propionyl CoA carboxylase (an enzyme that is involved in breaking down the amino acids). It is categorized as branched-chain organic acidemia which often presents symptoms early on in the neonatal period which comes with progressive encephalopathy.
10069	Acinetobacter refers to a particular group of bacteria that is commonly found in soil as well as in water. It can also thrive in the healthy skins of people, especially among healthcare personnel, causing all types of diseases. The acinetobacter infection is mostly contracted inside a healthcare facility.
10070	Athletes are more likely to suffer from anterior cruciate ligament injury or ACL, but quite uncommon for the general public who are not subjected to strenuous physical activities. An anterior cruciate is one of the two ligaments that crosses in the middle of the knee, connecting the thighbone and the shinbone. Hard twisting or some sudden stop while landing, running or a direct blow to the knee can injure the ACL.
10071	Acne vulgaris or just acne is a common skin disease which is caused by changes on the pilosebaceous units (structures of the skin which consist of sebaceous gland and a hair follicle). The severe cases of acne are often inflamed but it can also show up as non-inflamed. Lesions are common and they are called spots, zits or pimples. This condition is common during the stage of puberty (affecting about 85% of teeners) while some cases carry on to adulthood. Most acne cases diminish and then disappear over time and this begins during the early twenties of an individual's life. There are no means of predicting when the disease will totally disappear because some cases continue even when the person is already in his thirties or forties. Acne is an altered form of the Greek word akun (or skin eruption). The vernacular name bakne or bacne is used often to specify acne that is found at the back of a person.
10072	Acne Cystic otherwise known as the nodulocystic acne or the pseudo scars, is a medical condition that refers to an acne that usually developed into a small cysts.
10073	Acne keloidalis nuchae typically develops and affects the back of the head as well as the nape. This is caused by the hairs that grow into skin causing an inflammation and scarring. This condition has been found to be most common among people with curly and stiff hairs.
10074	Acne rosacea or simply Rosacea is a very common condition which affects over 45 million people all over the world. Although common, it is a misunderstood condition. This often affects white-skinned individuals who are of northwestern European descent. This has been nicknamed as the 'Celtic curse' by some Irish people. This often begins as mere redness and flushing (erythema) right on the center of the face, also the cheeks, forehead and the nose. It can also affect the chest and the neck. As this disorder progresses, other signs come up such as erythema that is semi-permanent; telangiectasia (or the opening of the surface facial blood vessels); small bumps or domed pustules; reddish gritty eyes, stinging or burning sensations, and the most advanced cases manifest rhinophyma or lobulated nose. This disorder is often confused with seborrheic dermatitis or acne vulgaris. It can co-exist with these two conditions and it can affect both sexes (with females thrice more vulnerable). This peaks on the age of 30 to 60. the primary diagnosis of this disease is mainly facial and when the ears or the scalp become involved, it is a suggestion of a different illness.
10075	Acoustic neuroma also known as a vestibular schwannoma is a primary intracranial tumor that is benign. This is a tumor of the cells that form myelin of the CN VIII or vestibulocochlear nerve. Neuroma is a derivation of a Greek word which means 'tumor of the nerve'. The name 'acoustic' is a misnomer because the tumor hardly occurs from the cochlear or acoustic part of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The precise medical name is vestibular schwannoma. This is because it engages the vestibular part of the eighth cranial nerve and it occurs from schwann cells (the cells that are responsible for the peripheral nervous system myelin sheath).
10075	Acoustic neuroma is a medical condition that is characterized by the growth of a tumor that usually develops in nerves near the ear. is a benign, usually slow-growing tumor that develops from certain nerves in the inner ear. No one knows exactly what causes acoustic neuroma. As an acoustic neuroma develops, it presses against the nerves related to balance and hearing, causing early symptoms such as: one-sided or high-tone hearing loss, ringing in the ear, dizziness, and problems with balance. Once a diagnosis of acustic neuroma is made, the doctor can describe the available treatment options.
10076	Ichthyosis is an inherited disorder of the skin. This disorder is an extreme type of ichthyosis which can afflict both sexes all over the world. When this disease is acquired because of a causal disorder, although, it is very rare; it is still not known how this occurs. But there are studies that claim that it can result from mutations of the genes. The mutated genes can be passed from one generation onto the next. The mutation is believed to cause the abnormality in the skin's standard lifecycle. Normal people shed dead skin cells unnoticed but patients of ichthyosis produce new cells of the skin at a rate where their rate of shedding could not cope. This way, there is a dead skin cell buildup and the patient's skin would then appear to be dry or scaly. Acquired ichthyosis often occurs in adulthood. It could occur before or after a systemic condition diagnosis.
10077	Acquired immune deficiency syndrome also termed as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a compilation infections and symptoms that result from a specific damage to an individual's immune system. This is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (or HIV) and other similar viruses such as SIV or FIV. The late phase of HIV and AIDS exist to slow down the viral progression. Currently, there is still no cure for this illness. AIDS can be transmitted through direct contacts of the bloodstream or of a mucous membrane with any of the body fluids such as semen, blood, vaginal fluid, breast milk, or preseminal fluid. The modes of transmission could be sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, oral sex, anal sex, or a contact with hypodermic needles that are contaminated with the virus. Another unfortunate means of getting the virus is the exchange of fluids between the baby and its mother during pregnancy.
10078	Syphilis is a venereal medical condition which is and which comes in two categories: acquired or congenital. Acquired syphilis is further divided into sub-categories which are early and late. The early stage consists of the primary, secondary and the early latent less than two years of being infected. The late sub-category is described as late latent greater than two years, tertiary which includes gummatous, neurological and cardiovascular involvement, the two latter forms are also termed as quartenary syphilis.
10079	Acrocephaly is a rare congenital syndrome which is often characterized by a narrowing of the pulmonary valve, retardation of the patient's mental development, and a pointy skull (or the skull's loftiness). More often than not, the head of the patient appears cone-like. A term that is similar to acrocephaly is oxycephaly. Oxycephaly has features that are similar to acrocephaly such as the coronal sutre and other sutures that close prematurely. Oxycephaly is the most severe type of of all craniostenoses.
10080	Small growths of skin that develop in some people on the neck, face, groin and armpits are called skin tags or acrochordons. These skin tags do not become cancerous or malignant since they are harmless.
10081	Acrocyanosis refers to a condition where the hands, feet or even the face persistently appear to have cyanotic or blue discoloration. The bluish color is caused by the lowered oxygen levels on the patient's extremities (some areas that can also be affected are the nipples, just the nose, or lips). The condition may not only manifest the pallor on the extremities but this discoloration could be accompanied by feelings of numbness, pins and needles sensation, soreness or even pain. The toes or fingers could also appear to be shiny and the tight-skinned. Acrocyanosis could also cause vasomotor disturbance (such as in the case of Raynaud's disease). This is a disease of the arterioles of the hands and feet that are exposed which also involves unusual contraction of the arteriolar walls which are magnified by exposing the areas to cold. This exposure results into the blue, mottled skin, sweating of the feet or hands, and chilling. It has been observed that patients who suffer from acrocyanosis may have acquired this condition because of the occurrence of other conditions before it such as emotional or mental disturbance. Neurocirculatory asthenia could also be an underlying cause. This condition can be subdivided into two forms: acrocyanosis (non-benign) with a sign which could allude to a more chronic medical concern; and acrocyanosis (benign) which is the more common condition which requires very little, if any, medical treatment. Females who are in their 20's are more vulnerable to the illness. The good thing about this condition is, it can improve as the patient ages.
10082	Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive disease which affects zinc metabolism. This is characterized by periorificial (in the region of natural orifices) and in the limbs (acral dermatitis), loss of hair (also known as alopecia), and diarrhea. Having acquired zinc deficiency is somewhat similar to acrodermatitis enteropathica because it, too, can be congenital. The other known terms for acrodermatitis enteropathica are: Brandt syndrome, congenital zinc deficiency, and Danbolt-cross syndrome.
10083	Acrodysostosis also known as acrodysplasia, Arkless-Graham, or Maroteaux-Malamut is defined as a very rare inborn skeletal illness which is marked by defects on the bones of feet, hands, and the nose. Retardation of the patient's learning and mental development is a common occurrence.
10084	Acrodysplasia or acrocephalosyndactyly is an uncommon medical condition which is often characterized by a bulbous nose, bony growths, and loose extra skin throughout infancy. This is also a very rare genetic disease. A synonymous word is acrocephalosyndactyly.
10085	Acrodystrophic neuropathy, also known as Morvan disease, is a rare autoimmune defect characterized by muscle malignancies, severe cramps, myotonia, delirium and insomnia. There are only about 14 recorded cases of the illness disease since it was first discovered.
10086	Acrofacial dysostosis or Nager syndrome is a term that was coined by Nager and DeReynier in 1948. This condition is described as a syndrome which involves the upper limbs and skull. The most ordinary type of acrofacial dysostosis is the Nager Type (NAFD) of the so-called pre-axial acrofacial dysostosis. Generally, the effects of Nager type acrofacial dysostosis are palpebral fissures that are down-slanted; micrognathia; coloboma of the lower eyelids; and absent or hypoplastic radii or thumbs.
10087	Acromegaly was derived from the Greek word 'akros' meaning 'extremities' or 'extreme' and 'megalos' which means 'large'. This is a syndrome which results as the pituitary gland has an overproduction of hGH or growth hormone following the closure of the epiphyseal plate. There are several disorders that could cause the pituitary gland to come up with this circumstance. Most of these conditions involve a tumor that produces GH which is derived from a distinctive cell type (called somatotrophs) and named pituitary adenoma.
10088	Acromicric dysplasia is a very rare inherited illness that is often characterized by unusually short feet and hands, retardation of the patient's growth and delays on bone maturation which lead to short stature, and mild abnormalities of the face. The face often appears with a happy or 'smiling' expression thus the descriptive word geleophysic which is derived from the Greek word 'gelios' which means 'laughing' and 'phylis' meaning 'nature'. Most of the number of cases for this illness has occurred in random for no obvious reason (sporadic). It has not been ruled out, though, that this is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder. The disease database clearly indicates that acromicric dysplasia is similar to Geleophysic dwarfism (also known as Geleophysic dysplasia) and Focal mucopolysaccharidosis.
10089	Acromicric skeletal dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder that features unusually short hands and feet. Patients with this disease may suffer from slow development and delayed bone growth that often leads to a short stature with facial deformities. No treatments yet are found for this disorder.
10090	Acrophobia is derived from the Greek word 'akpoc' which means 'summit'. This phobia is described as the irrational dread of high places. This belongs to a certain category of phobias which are called motion and space discomfort (these two share like etiology and choices of treatment). This phobia could become very dangerous because those who suffer from it could experience attacks of panic when on a high place. As a result, they could become so agitated and they would have troubles getting themselves down to the ground safely. Vertigo is often associated or link with acrophobia and it is sometimes misconstrued as the phobia itself. The former is a feeling of nausea which is correctly described as a sensation of being spun. Vertigo can be caused by acrophobia when the person gets to a high place and then experience nausea. This type of vertigo that is triggered by heights is referred to as height vertigo.
10091	ACTH deficiency or isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency is a disorder which arises from a decrease or absence of the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (also known as ACTH hormone). The pituitary gland is the one which produces this hormone. A decrease on the concentration of adrenocorticotropic in a person's blood would lead to reduced adrenal hormone secretions. This reduction of secretion of adrenal hormones could result into hypoadrenalism or adrenal deficiency. Adrenal insufficiency would then lead to loss of weight, a lack of appetite or anorexia nervosa (which is also a psychological disorder), nausea, weakness, vomiting, and hypotension or low blood pressure. Other uncommon symptoms include the lack or absence of pubic hair in some female patients; the lack or absence armpit hairs; having pale skin. These symptoms can be so general that is why proper diagnosis is often totally missed or delayed. For this reason, some physicians tend to believe that the disorder could be more common than had been previously thought.
10092	Sometimes known as "sailor's lip" or "farmer's lip," actinic cheilitis is a precancerous condition related to cumulative lifetime sun exposure. People with this disorder often complain of cracking of the lips and persistent dryness where the lower lip is most often affected.
10093	Actinic keratosis also known as solar keratosis, even AK is a premalignant condition of the skin where the signs include crusty, scaly, thick patches. This disorder is common among fair-skinned individuals who are often exposed under the sun (white people have less protection from their skin's pigment). This condition is often accompanied by damage made by the sun. Since a few of these are pre-cancer carcinomas, they should be attended to immediately. When a person's skin is exposed under the sun, the signs such as crustiness and thickness begin to appear. These bumps are often rough and dry and they start out as flat areas but soon develop into something tough which often resembles a wart. Actinic keratosis is about 2.0-6.0 mm. in range and they can be light or dark, pink or tan, it can even be red in color or it can be a combination of all the mentioned colors. It could appear on the areas that are exposed under the sun such as the chest, back, ears, neck, face, scalp, forearms, hands, and lips.
10094	Actinomycetales infection is an infection which is bacterial in nature. This comes from the order of actinobacteria. The alternate names for this type of infection are: actinomycete infection; actinomycetales infection; or actinomycte infection.
10095	Actinomycosis (pronounced ak-tuh-nuh-my-KOH-sihs) is a rare and infectious bacterial disease among humans. This is generally caused by Propionibacterium propionicus and actinoyces israelii, A.gerencseriae. This condition is unlikely a polymicrobial infection. Actinomycosis is a sub-acute to chronic bacterial disease which is caused by the filamentous, anaerobic to microaerophilic, and gram positive bacteria that are non-acid fast.
10096	Activated protein C resistance is a hemostatic disease which is characterized by a reduced anticoagulant response to APC or activated protein C. The result is a heightened risk of venous thrombosis. The activated protein C resistance or APCr was first studied and reported by Dahlback in 1993. Activated protein C with protein S as its co-factor degrades Factor VIIIa and Factor Va. Activated protein C resistance is the failure of protein C to cleave Factor VIIIa and/or Factor Va. This permits for a longer extent of thrombin generation and could proceed to the hypercoabulable phase. The most common form of hereditary resistance to activated protein C is Factor V Leiden. Acquired types occur together with elevated concentrations of Factor VIII. It has been evaluated that up to 64% of people who are afflicted with venous thromboembolism could also have activated protein C resistance.
10097	Acutane embryopathy is a rare disease that is caused by exposure of the fetus to retinoids and which often results into physical and mental defects at birth.
10098	Acute articular rheumatism is a rare and non-contagious medical condition brought about by a bacterial joint infection that can possibly come with a heightened risk of the development of heart complications. Adults are the common victims affected by this disease. However, statistics have shown that less than 200, 000 Americans are afflicted with this condition, which explains why it is categorized as a rare disease.
10099	Acute Beryllium Disease, also known as acute berylliosis, is the inflammation of the lungs due to exposure to beryllium.
10100	Acute Bronchitis is a medical condition that is characterized by the inflammation of the large bronchi tubes in the lungs.
10101	Also known as the Abt-Letterer-Siwe disease, acute disseminated histiocytosis-X is a rare progressive kind of hystiocytosis. In this condition, high levels of histiocytosin are found in the bone marrow, causing deterioration of the organ issues. This illness difficult to treat, and is linked with diabetes insipidius.
10102	Acute erythroblastic leukemia is also known by other medical terms such as erythremic myelosis, erythroleukemia and the DiGuglielmo syndrome, which is the uncontrolled production of immature and undeveloped erythrocytes, more popularly known as the red blood cells. This type of leukemia is a rare form of cancer that originates from the marrow and blood.
10103	Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis is more popularly known as Sweet's syndrome, which is a type of skin disorder characterized by sudden appearance of painful skin lesions and fever. This condition often appear on the patient's back, face, arms or neck and red bumps may rapidly increase in size and can possibly progress to blisters.
10104	Acute gouty arthritis is characterized as sudden pain attacks in the joints, most especially in the legs and feet due to the buildup of uric acid in the joints. Gout is generally caused by an abnormality in the individual's metabolism which results to the proliferation if uric acid that consequently reduced the ability of the kidney to get rid of the uric acid. Patients suffering from sickle cell anemia, diabetes and obesity as well as kidney disorders are among the people who are most likely to develop acute gouty arthritis.
10105	Acute idiopathic polyneuritis, also known as Gullain-Barre syndrome (GBS), is a rare but progressive paralyzing disorder of the peripheral nerves.
10106	Acute intermittent porphyria is a very rare metabolic disorder that is characterized by an abnormal deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase enzyme that would result to the buildup of polyphyrins. This medical condition is inherited and is passed on from one generation to another.
10107	Acute kidney failure is characterized by the sudden loss of the ability of the kidneys to perform its normal functions, which includes eliminating the excess waste and fluid from the blood. When the kidney is damaged and losses its filtering capability, a highly dangerous level of fluid may accumulate in the body.
10108	Acute liver failure is considered a serious medical emergency that typically occurs when the liver rapidly loses the ability to function. This medical condition gradually develops through the years due to some factors such as alcohol abuse and hepatitis virus. This condition requires immediate medical attention since lack of treatment can prove to be highly fatal
10109	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, otherwise known as acute lymphocytic leukemia is another form of cancer of the white blood cells. In this case, the immature and malignant white blood cells continues to multiply in an abnormally rapid thereby causing overproduction in the bone marrow. This disease causes damage and death by actively crowding out the Bone marrow's normal cells and spread to the other organs in the body. ALL is found to be common among children and young adults.
10110	Acute monoblastic leukemia otherwise known as acute monocytic leukemia is an acute type of myeloid leukemia. For patients to be considered a victim of AML-M5, he must have more than 20% blasts in the marrow. Monoblasts are largely distinguished for displaying a rough, circular nucleus and a delicate lacy chromatin.
10111	Acute mountain sickness, or more popularly known as altitude sickness is a pathological condition which is caused by exposure to very low air pressure. This is common in outdoors with high altitudes, usually above 8,000 feet. This is caused by a reduction of partial pressure in the oxygen.
10112	Acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) is known to be the most common type of leukemia, which is found in adults, although people pf all ages can be affected by this serious medical condition. In AML, underdeveloped leukemia cells accumulate in the patient's bone marrow, thereby causing the destruction and replacement of cells that would produce normal blood cells.
10113	Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis or ANUG is characterized as a plymicrobial infection of the patient's gums that normally leads to bleeding, inflammation, necrotic gum tissue and deep ulcerations. Patients with this condition also suffer from fever and halitosisi. ANUG is also known as Vincent's angina, a popular term whioch was coined in WW1 when a great number of soldiers suffered from this condition.
10114	Acute pancreatitis is characterized as the rapid onset of inflammation of the pancreas. Depending on the severity of the condition, serious complications and high mortality occur despite treatment. This disease is usually prevalent among individuals with bile duct obstruction of prolonged alcohol abuse.
10115	Acute Pancreatitis is a medical condition whereby there is an inflammation of the pancreas.
10116	Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) is a unusual form of eye disease that mostly affects Caucasia people ranging from ages 20-30 years old. This medical condition is characterized by a patient's central vision either in one or both eyes is affected or vision is completely lost due to inflammation a at thed the buildup of fluid in the back of the eye.
10117	Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a known subtype of AML or acute myologenous leukemia, which is a form of cancer of the bone marrow and the blood. APL patients suffer from the abnormal accumulation of underdeveloped granulocytes . APL is characterized as a disorder brought about by chromosomal translocation.
10118	Acute renal failure is more popularly known as acute kidney failure or injury, and is characterized by the rapid loss of renal utility that causes serious damage to the kidney. Depending on the durationg and the extent of the condition, the accumulation may also be accompanied with metabolic disturbances such as acidification of the blood, fluid balance changes and elevated postassium levels. This is a serious medical condition that requires immediate medical attention.
10119	Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or adult respiratory distress syndrome, is a serious reaction to various forms of injuries to the lung. This is the most important disorder that is caused by an increased permeability pulmonary edema. ARDS is a severe lung disease caused by different direct and indirect issues. It is marked by inflammation of the lung parenchyma leading to impaired gas exchange with concomitant systemic release of inflammatory mediators causing inflammation, hypoxemia and frequently resulting in multiple organ failure. This condition is life threatening and often lethal, typically requiring mechanical ventilation and admission to an intensive care unit. A less severe form of this disease is called acute lung injury (ALI). ARDS most commonly signified adult respiratory distress syndrome to differentiate it from infant respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants. However, as this type of pulmonary edema also arises in children, ARDS has gradually shifted to mean acute rather than adult. The differences with the typical infant syndrome remain the same.
10120	Acute sinusitis is characterized by the inflammation of the nose and nasal passages that interferes with the normal drainage of the mucus in the sinuses. This causes difficulty in breathing with the throbbing sensation across the face, accompanied by headaches, and nagging coughs.
10121	Acute toxic epidermolysis is a rare immunological defect that affects the skin. In this condition blisters develop on the skin and causes excessive peeling; the dermis then becomes more exposed to heat and substances and may resort to scalding.
10122	Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a medical condition involving the death of tubular cells that form the tubule that transports urine to the ureters while reabsorbing 99% of the water, highly concentrating the salts and metabolic byproducts. Tubular cells continually replace themselves, and if the cause of ATN is taken out, then recovery is likely. ATN presents with acute renal failure and is one of the most frequent causes of ARF. The presence of "muddy brown casts" of epithelial cells present in the urine during urinalysis is pathognomonic for ATN. ATN may be classified as either toxic or ischemic. Toxic ATN arises when the tubular cells are exposed to a toxic substance (nephrotoxic ATN). Ischemic ATN occurs when the tubular cells do not get adequate amounts of oxygen, a condition they are highly sensitive to due to their very high metabolism.
10123	ACY2 deficiency is a genetic disorder that features a spongy degeneration of the central nervous system. The signs that indicate the onset of the disease begin at infancy, usually characterized by progressive mental decline and rapid loss of head control, balance and coordination. Patients with the disease have an abnormally large head due to swelling. This disease is caused by an abnormal mutation in the ASPA gene that makes the cells unable to produce an important enzyme for brain and muscle development, aspartocylase.
10124	Medium Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MCADD) is a rare hereditary disease that is the result of the lack of an enzyme required to convert fat to energy. People with MCADD cannot refrain from eating for very long. Fasting starts after the body has used all the food that the person has eaten, then begins to use the body's own fat to make energy. When people with MCADD fast, they can experience a variety of serious life threatening symptoms or even death. Persons with MCADD cannot utilize this fat to make energy, consequently, the body begins to fail and malfunction once the food the person has eaten runs out.
10125	Very-Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (VLCADD) is a rare autosomal recessive condition in which the body fails to oxidize fatty acids because an enzyme is either missing or not functioning correctly. Long-chain 3-hydroxy acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCHAD) is 1 of 3 enzymatic activities that comprise the trifunctional protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The other 2 activities of the protein are long-chain 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase (LCKT) and 2-enoyl coenzyme A (CoA) hydratase (LCEH). The protein is an octamer made up of 4 alpha subunits that contain the LCEH and LCHAD activities, and 4 beta subunits that contain the LCKT activity. This enzyme complex helps metabolize long-chain fatty acids, and the LCHAD activity is specific for compounds of C12-C16 chain length. The genes for the alpha and beta subunits have been traced to chromosome 2. Affected infants with LCHAD deficiency, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, arise in infancy with acute hypoketotic hypoglycemia. These episodes usually appear for the first time after a fast, which usually occurs in the context of intercurrent illness with vomiting.
10126	Short Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (SCADD) is a condition in which the body fails to oxidize fatty acids because an enzyme is either missing or not functioning correctly. Short-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD) is a rare condition that stops the body from converting certain fats into energy, especially during periods without food (fasting). People affected with this disorder are not able to break down a certain group of fats called short-chain fatty acids efficiently. Some affected infants will display vomiting, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), a lack of energy (lethargy), poor feeding, and failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Other features of this disorder may include poor muscle tone (hypotonia), developmental delays, seizures, and a small head size (microcephaly). The symptoms of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency may be activated by periods of fasting or during illnesses such as viral infections. In some cases, signs and symptoms may not exhibit themselves until adulthood, when some individuals may develop muscle weakness and wasting. Other people with gene mutations that can lead to this disorder may have such mild symptoms that they are never diagnosed.
10127	Ad14 otherwise known as the Adenovirus Serotype 14 medical condition that is said to be a mutated form of the common cold.
10128	Addiction was a term used to describe an attachment, devotion, dedication, inclination, etc. Nowadays, however, the term addiction is used to describe a recurring compulsion by an individual to engage in some specific activity, despite harmful consequences to the individual's health, social life, or mental state. The term is often reserved for drug addictions but it is sometimes applied to other compulsions, such as compulsive overeating and problem gambling. Factors that have been suggested as causes of addiction include biological/pharmacological, genetic, and social factors.
10129	Addison Anemia is a medical condition caused by the malabsorption of Vitamin B-12 and is relatively common form of anemia.
10130	Addison's disease (also known as chronic adrenal insufficiency, hypocortisolism or hypocorticism) is a rare endocrine disorder in which the adrenal gland produces inadequet amounts of steroid hormones (glucocorticoids and often mineralocorticoids). It may arise in children as well as adults, and may occur as the result of a large number of underlying causes. The condition is named after Dr Thomas Addison, the British physician who initially described the condition in his 1855 On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsules. The adjective "Addisonian" is used for features of the condition, as well as individuals with Addison's disease. The condition is typically diagnosed with blood tests, medical imaging and additional investigations. Treatment is with replacement of the certain hormones (oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone). If the disease is the result of an underlying problem, this is addressed. Regular follow-up and monitoring for other health problems is required.
10131	Adducted thumb syndrome recessive form, also known as Christian syndrome or Craniostenosis arthrogryposis cleft palate, is a rare disease that affects multiple systems which causes malformations of the palate, thumbs, and upper limbs.
10132	Mesenteric adenitis is characterized as an inflammation of the mesenteric lymph nodes found in the abdomen. If the inflammation is found in the right lower quadrant, most people would mistake it as appendicitis but is often preceded by sore throat.
10133	Adenocarcinoma of the lung (or lung cancer) is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both women and men in the United States and throughout the world. Lung cancer has beaten breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. In 2007, 160,390 people were projected to die from lung cancer in the United States, which is more than the number of deaths from colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer combined. Only about 2% of those diagnosed with lung cancer that has spread to other areas of the body are living five years after the diagnosis, although the survival rates for lung cancers diagnosed at a very early stage are higher, with approximately 49% surviving for five years or longer. Cancer arises when normal cells undergo a transformation that causes them to grow and multiply without the normal controls. The cells form a mass or tumor that varies from the surrounding tissues from which it arises. Tumors are dangerous because they take nutrients, oxygen, and space from healthy cells.
10134	Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon form of malignant neoplasm that develops within secretory glands, most commonly the major and minor salivary glands of the head and neck. Other sites of origin include the trachea, lacrimal gland, skin, breast, and vulva. This neoplasm is defined by its characteristic histologic appearance. Adenoid cystic cancer (AdCC) is a very rare type of cancer that can develop in many different body sites. It most often arises in the areas of the head and neck, in particular the salivary glands; but has also been reported in the breast, lacrimal gland of the eye, lung, brain, bartholin gland, and the trachea. It is sometimes known as adenocyst, adenocystic, malignant cylindroma, adenoidcystic, ACC, AdCC.
10135	Adenoma is characterized as a collection ogu growth that is glandular in origin. Adenomas usually grow in major body organs such as the adrenal, pituitary, thyroid and colon. These growths are usually benign in nature but can progress into malignant over. While it can be ntbenign, it can also present some potentially serious complications by mass effect and production of large volumes of hormones.
10136	Adrenal adenomas are categorized as benign or a non-cancerous form of tumour of the adrenal gland. It can arise from the gland's outer layer or what is known as as the adrebal cortez. Ig the adenoma produces hormones, it is considered as a functioning adenoma and non-functioning for adenomas that do not produce hormones.
10137	Adenomyosis is more popularly known as amenorrhea, and is characterized as a serious health complication among women that consist of the detection of an ectopic endometrial tissue, which normally lines the uterus, are found to extend into the muscular and fibrous tissue of the uterus.There are two known types of adenomyosis-primary and secondary. This disorder may coexist along with external endometriosis.
10138	Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency (ADA) is a highly rare genetic disorder and is categorized as a form of severe combined immunodeficiency that largely affects body's immune system. To date, there are only about a dozen documented cases of ADA deficiency. This genetic disease is known to be quite fatal, and often lead to death if afflicted patients do not seek treatment. People who have this disease usually lead a sheltered life and live in enclosed environment to prevent exposure to infectious agents.
10139	Adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMD) is a type of muscle-specific deficiency that is a common cause of many exercise-induced myopathy and is one of the most common causes of metabolic myopathy among human beings.
10140	Adenoviruses are among the most common cause of respiratory illnesses. People who already have a compromised immune system can become more susceptible to developing more serious medical conditions when exposed to this type of virus.
10141	Adenylosuccinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease that affects purine synthesis. Among the main features of this disease are slow development of psychomotor skills as well as epileptic seizures and autism. It can be detected by means of testing abnormal purine metabolites present in body fluids. There is no cure available yet for the disorder.
10142	Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is a type of disorder of the purine metabolism that affects patients both behaviorally and biochemically. Patients afflicted with this disorder normally have autistic features and display some mild psychomotor delays.
10143	An adhesion is a band of fibrous tissue that binds the unconnected anatomic surfaces, which are separated from each other. It develops commonly in the abdomen after trauma or injury. Sometimes it is a congenital defect like the obstruction of the intestine.
10144	Adhesive capsulitis is also known as frozen shoulders, a condition that is characterized by the abnormal stiffness and pain on the shoulder joint area. As the condition progresses and worsens, the individual will experience a limited range of motion. This condition usually affects one shoulder at a time.
10145	Adie syndrome, sometimes reffered to as Adie's Tonic Pupil or Holmes-Adies Syndrome is categorized as a neurological disorder that affects the autonomic nervous system and the pupil of the patient's eye. It causes damage to the postganglionic fibers of the eye that is usually brought about by bacterial or viral infection.
10146	Adiposis dolorosa, is also known as Dercum's disease and Ander's disease, which is a type of a rare disease that is characterized by some multiple painful lipomas that usually arise in adult life. Among the individuals commonly afflicted with this disease are those who are also battling with obesity and occurs on both men and women.
10147	Adrenal cancer is a very rare disease that begins in the patient's adrenal glands, which is located on the top section of the kidneys. The tumors can rapidly increase the production of hormones. The good news is about 99% of adrenal tumors are non-cancerous and would not normally require any form of treatment when small in size. It does not produce any detectable symptoms which is why patients diagnosed with this disorder find out about this condition purely by accident in other examination for completely unrelated diseases.
10148	Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) generally refers to several autosomal recessive medical conditions that are results from some biochemical pathway of the steroidogenesis of the cortisol from cholesterol by the patient's adrenal glands. Majority of these conditions involve lesser or greater production of sex steroids and can also greatly alter the development of primary and secondary sex characteristics in affected individuals.
10149	There are four types of congenital adrenal hypoplasia that have been recognized and they are the following: an X-linked type or the OMIM 300200 which is caused by a deletion or mutation of the AHCH gene or the DAX1 gene (found in the X chromosome dosage-receptive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenital vital region). This type is often linked with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. It might be a component of an adjacent deletion of chromosome (this may include congenital adrenal hypoplasia, OMIM 310200 or the Duchenne muscular dystrophy and OMIM 307030 or glyce3rol kinase deficiency; the second type is the autosomal recessive type and it is caused by a deletion or mutation of the gene which is responsible for coding for SF-1 or steroidogenic factor 1 on OMIM 184757 or chromosome 9q99. This type is also linked with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; The third type is an autosomal recessive type. This type has a vague etiology (or OMIM 240200); The fourth type of adrenal hypoplasia which is linked with the retardation of intrauterine growths, genital defects, and metaphysical dysplasia is the OMIM 300290 or the IMAGe (intrauterine growth retardation, metaphysical dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenital, genital defects) association. The X-linked type adrenal hypoplasia congenital is a disease which is mainly acquired by males. It usually involves several endocrine tissues of the body most especially the gmall glands above the kidneys or the adrenal glands. The characteristics that often manifest are a reduction in the function of the adrenal gland; hypoglycemia; dehydration, feeding difficulties; and shock. Other male patients might also be sexually underdeveloped. The females who are rarely affected also have adrenal insufficiency and a deficiency of sex hormones.
10150	An adrenal incidentaloma is an adrenal mass which is seen during the imaging for other causes that are non-adrenal related. This means that the lesion was discovered serendipitously. Adrenal incidentaloma is the most common adrenal disorder and it is found during 1-5% of CT scans for the abdomen. 5-10% of patients who are diagnosed with adrenal incidentaloma have masses that are non-functioning (this is based on postmortem examinations). This disease affects both males and females with most of the incidentalomas being hormonally inactive and benign. There are only a few numbers of cases where adrenalectomy is required (and this is done only when the lesion becomes functioning and malignant). The diagnostic assessment often evaluates the hormonal activity of the lesion and if it is malignant. Assessment of functions require plasma dihydroepiadosterone; urinary catecholamines for 24 hours and metanephrines; a low dosage of a test of dexamethasone suppression; serum ACTH; standing serum renin to aldosterone ration for hypertension and hypokalemia. The evaluation of the danger of malignancy requires MRI or CT scans; on CT lesions that are malignant are not regular, non-homogeneous and have great attenuation; for lesions that are MRI malignant, an clear concentration on T2 weighed image; it may also be useful to have CT guided cytology; there is also a need to exclude paechromocytoma before this procedure;
10151	There are two classifications for adrenal insufficiency and they are: primary and secondary. The primary adrenal insufficiency happens when the adrenal gland dysfunctions. The secondary adrenal insufficiency which is also named central adrenal insufficiency happens there is a lack of CRH secretion or the corticotrophin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus; or it could be the lack of ACTH secretion which is the corticotropic hormone from the pituitary. The second type leads to adrenal cortex hypofunction. Further classifications include acquired and congenital.
10152	Adrenocortical carcinoma also called as ACC or adrenal cortical carcinoma and adrenal cortex cancer is a cancer that is aggressive which originates from the cortex (a tissue that produces steroid hormones) of the adrenal gland. Adrenocortical carcinoma is a tumor that is rare with an incidence of 1-2 in every 1,000,000 individuals annually. ACC has a bimodal allocation by age (most of the cases cluster among children that are under the age of 6 and in adults at 30-40 years of age). ACC can result into many syndromes such as Cushing's syndrome, virilization, Conn syndrome, and feminization. It also commonly metastizes or invades neighboring tissues and the survival rate is estimated at only 20-35%.
10153	The more proper term for adrenogenital syndrome is congenital adrenal hyperplasia or CAH. This refers to numerous other autosomal recessive disor which result from biochemical paths of cortisol setoidogenesis from cholesterol done by the adrenal glands. Most number of these conditions could have lesser or greater sex steroid production and they can alter primary or secondary sex characteristic development among adults, children and infant patients. Only a few cases of people with CAH can be appropriated with intersex condition although this attracted the attention of the American public in the 90's and since then, there have been various accounts that have been circulated. It is estimated that 95% of CAH cases are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Conditions Caused by CAH The most common conditions that are caused by adrenogenital syndrome are: ambiguous genitals (in some female patients wherein it can be initially hard to know the exact sex of the infant); salt-wasting that causes vomiting (which may lead to dehydration and eventually-death); the early appearance of pubice or the occurrence failure or the delay of puberty (including sexual infantilism); too much facial hair; virilization; irregular menstrual periods during the adolescent stage; infertility caused by anovulation; and hypertension.
10154	Adrenoleukodystrophy is also known as ALD, Sudanophilic leukodystrophy and Schilder's disease. This is a rare disorder that is inherited which often leads to progressive damage of the brain, adrenal gland failure and eventually, death. ALD belongs to a group of disorders that are inherited which are called Leukodystrophies. Leukodystrophies often progressively destroy the myelin (a complex fatty neutral tissue which insulates numerous nerves of the peripheral and central nervous systems). The absence of myelin intensifies destruction. Patients of this disorder have a missing essential protein called the transporter protein. The transporter protein is needed in carrying an enzyme (the one used in breaking down long chain fatty acid in a normal person's diet). A long chain fatty acid accumulation can bring about brain damage and adrenal gland damage. Usually, the patients of ALD are males who inherit the X-linked disorder. Leudodystrophies are not similar to demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis where the myelin is normally formed but is eventually lost through immunologic dysfunction or for other causes.
10155	Adrenomyodystrophy is a rare genetic disease which is often characterized by chief adrenal insufficiency, acute psychomotor retardation, dystrophic myopathy, and an acutely swollen bladder which can result into death.
10156	Still's disease was first discovered as a type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that is common among children but is now also discovered to have a few cases in adults. The adult type is called the adult onset Still's disease (or AOSD). AOSD was first described by an English doctor in 1971. The physician's name was Bywaters who is also famous for his work on the crush syndrome. There are varying theories as to the cause of Still's disease. There is a suggestion that it originated from a microbacterial infection. To this day, the cause of the illness remains unknown. It is more securely established that the disorder's pathogenesis is autoimmune.
10157	Adult Schizophrenia is considered to be one of the most complex of all identified mental health disorders. It is characterized by a severe and chronic, often disabling disturbance of the person's brain that causes distorted thinking, unusual strange feelings and disturbed behavior and use of language.
10158	Agammaglobulinemia is also called hypogammaglobulinemia. It is the most ordinary type of primary immunodeficiency which accounts to about 50% of all the cases. The three major kinds can be defined as: early onset, late onset, and X-linked. It was only after more than 50 years since the clinical manifestation was first recorded in 1952 by a certain Bruton. He described that the defect on the molecule in XLA or X-linked agammaglobulinemia has been explicated. To honor Bruton, the responsible gene was named Btk which means Bruton tyrosine kinase. It is estimated that 90% of the patients with the early-onset kind of agammaglobulinemia and the lack of B cells have defects on their Btk genes. The late-onset type is often referred to as the CVID or Common Variable Immunodeficiency. The last type is the early-onset non-Bruton agammaglobuliemia with absent or just low serum immunoglobulin (or Ig). Most of the cases are representative of a very heterogenous group which includes Ig deficiency with an increase in immunoglobulin M or hyper-IgM syndrome. There are also some infants who have an initial reading of low Ig level which soon increases to the normal level. This is named as Transient Hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy. Currently, the production of defective antibodies and the low circulation of a number of B cells were descriptive of some female infants and some males who do not have any Btk defects. These records imply the participation of other genes.
10159	Aganglionosis is a medical term used to describe absence of the ganglia or ganglion cells from the myenteric plexus.
10160	Agenesis of the corpus callosum is a rare congenital defect characterized by the absence of the corpus callosum, the protective tissue of the brain resulting to disconnection of the brain hemispheres.
10161	Ageusia is a medical state in which the tongue loses its ability to taste. In this condition the tongue can no longer differentiate sweetness from salt, sour, bitter and umami flavors. The taste buds may not appear to be swollen but the nerves of the tongue are no longer responsive to the stimuli. Ageusia is caused by neurological problems in the brain, lack of vitamin B3 in the endocrine system and side effects brought about by anti-rheumatic drugs.
10162	Aggressive fibromatosis is an unusual type of tumor that is locally persistent but not malevolent or malignant. Patient's symptoms will depend on the precise location and size of the tumor and also whether it reduces adjacent structures.
10163	Aging, also known as the cycle of life, is any form of change of an organism as time passes. There are many dimensions to aging such the physical, psychological, mental, and emotional aspects. For example, the time of reaction of a human being is lessened or slowed as he ages while his wisdom and knowledge of facts may improve. There should be a distinction between universal aging (where all people go through) and probabilistic aging (which is a type of aging that occurs only to some and not all individuals). An example of probabilistic aging is the manifestation of diabetes mellitus. Chronological aging refers to the actual age of an individual and it can clearly be distinguished from social aging (where the society expects people to behave in accordance to their age and status). The third type of aging is biological aging (which is the person's physical state as he ages). Age measurement is done through entire years or months in the case of infants. An individual's birthday is often a significant event. As to mental aging, it is a bit more challenging to categorize individuals under this type because an older person does not guarantee mental or emotional capacities that are greater than the younger generation.
10164	Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia is characterized as a condition that typically occurs when the bone marrow is scarred, resulting to its failure to function properly. With the reduced production from the bone marrow, the liver and the spleen will produce the necessary blood cells, causing it to become enlarged. This condition gradually develops through the years and often found in individuals over 50 years old.
10165	Agnosia or failure to know is a condition in which the person is unable to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells without any defective in a specific sense. There are different types of agnosia. The Autotopagnosia, the person is unable to identify the parts of the body. Visual agnosia the person cannot recognize a visual objects. Another type is Alexia, Inability to recognize text. We also have color agnosia, the patient has difficulty in distinguishing between color perception versus color recognition. Prosopagnosia also called as faceblindness or facial agnosia , the affected person is unable to recognize faniliar faces. Expressive agnosia is a type o g agnosia that the person cannot perceive different facial perception. Visual Verbal agnosia, the patient cannot understand spoken words. Auditory agnosia. The person can hear but unable to determine environmental and non-verbal auditory signs. Amusia, unable to identify music. Somatosensory agnosia or Astereognosia the patient is unable to identify object that is touch. Time Agnosia another type of agnosia that characterized with loss of comprehension of the time and duration of events. Apraxia or motor (body) agnosia it involves loss of ability to determine physical actions thus lead to repetitive of action.
10166	Agoraphobia is usually referred to as "fear of open spaces" though this explanation is simple and confusing. Agoraphobia is like an irrational fear or anxiety related with unknown environment or events or situations though this explanation also oversimplifies a complicated topic.. Panic attacks from panic disorder, usually causes agoraphobia to arise in several situations and the fear of places or situations happen when these were the reasons of the panic attacks. Agoraphobia in other words is the "fear of having another panic attack" or simply the fear of something or somewhere that may cause a panic attack. A violent sequence situates in where worry or fear of certain places or circumstances create a panic attack more possible to happen, which in turn elevates the level of anxiety. No matter what the explanation is, agoraphobia can not be only put pressure emotionally but it can really turn to be devastating which results to a life of self-imposed loneliness.
10167	Agyria which actually means smooth brain is an unusual brain formation disorder distinguished by the absence of normal folds in the brain. Malfunctioning neuronal movement is the cause of Agyria where in the nerve cells travel from their original place to their stable location. It is a kind of cephalic disorder. Convolutions or gyri refer to the folds in the brain and this forms the surface of the normal brain. Young patients who have Agyria has have a lack of or partially formed convolutions which makes the exterior of the brain smooth.
10168	Agyria pachygyria polymicrogyria is an abnormal development of the human brain distinguished by a huge amount of small folds or concolutions (gyri) on the exterior of the brain. The entire surface or other parts of the brain may be involved.
10169	Aicardi syndrome is an unusual abnormality syndrome distinguished by the lack of a major structure in the brain referred to as corpus callosum, the existence of abnormalities in the retina adn seizures in the form of immature spasms. An X-linked dominant trait is inherited in Aicardi syndrome that is fatal in males.
10170	Aichmophobia is the tremendous and unreasonable fear of being touched by a finger or any pointed materials or objects such as needles or injections.
10171	AIDS means Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome which means that the person may get infected by the disease and it will then cause a weakening of his system that resists or fights disease. The disease is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV. When the person gets infected by the virus, and the body creates its own "antibodies" to fight off the infection, it is when he is called HIV positive. Thus, the person is called HIV positive when he has these HIV antibodies. However, being HIV positive is different from having AIDS. It is common to find HIV positive person who have lived for many years without getting AIDS although AIDS is generally developed from HIV. A person may get infected with HIV through different ways, such as through blood infection and through semen or vaginal fluids. Thus, having sex with a person with HIV, receiving blood or using the same syringe with the person with HIV may result into getting infected. A child usually gets infected with HIV if the mother has the virus. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) it is estimated that there are around 1.2 million persons in the US are infected with HIV virus or have AIDS. Despite the number, the death rate due to AIDS has been reduced significantly since the time when it was the leading cause of death in the 90s. This is because of the new treatments available at present. HIV becomes AIDS when the immune system of the person infected with HIV is severely damaged. Thus, a person with no more than 200 CD 4 cells (less than 14% CD4 cells) in his body has AIDS. IF the person has AIDS he is more likely to get Pneumocystis pneumonia (PC), a certain lung infection; a Kaposi's sarcoma, a skin cancer; a Cytomegalovirus or infection affecting the eyes and Candida or a fungal infection in the mouth or infections in the throat or vagina. These infections are called opportunistic infections or infections which take advantage of the weak immune system. There is no known cure for AIDS however, at present there are available drugs which slows then development or progress of the HIV virus. At the same time these drugs slows down the effect or the damage done by the HIV to the immune system. There are also other drugs to help the patient treat or prevent the opportunistic infections. The latest drugs available are very effective in reducing the rate of the common opportunistic infections
10172	AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC) is one of the most common complications of HIV-1 infection. It is severe and is greatly associated with high morbidity. Its pathogenesis is still a mystery although as compared with other opportunistic infections of HIV, it is believed to be caused directly by the HIV-1 virus. ADC was first seen alongside the AIDS epidemic. As with the term, there is the persistent cognitive deterioration which not only affects the intellect of the patient but including the motor complex and behavior. Also, myelopahty is an important aspect of the ADC. The moment the patient is diagnosed with the ADC, it is staged according to the ADC Staging System. The staging is composed of five steps which are based on the cognitive and motor incapacity of the patient. The earlier stage is when there are neurologic symptoms but without the functional impairment and the advanced stage is when there is severe dysfunction. Generally, ADC affects the patient's cognition, motor skills and behavior. Usually the cognitive and motor skills are the first ones affected and the diagnosis is usually made when the patient manifest impairment of these skills. In a study conducted on the ADC, it was found that ADC is commonly found for those with advanced HIV-1 infection although it is also commonly found in those with preserved helper lymphocyte. This means that immunosuppression has an effect on the development of the complex. According to the data by the Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), ADC is strongly associated with the advanced stage of HIV. Moreover it also showed that there is strong relationship between survival rate and the development of stage 2 and over of ADC. Compared with the mortality rate of Pneumocystic carinii pneumonia, the 6-months cumulative mortality rate of ADC is three times greater. Compared with other neurologic diseases it is almost the same is the 85% rate if PML, 70% of CNS lymphoma and 51% of cerebral toxoplasmosis. The high rate may be attributed to ineffectiveness of antiviral treatment, the vulnerability of neurologic debility and the hopelessness attitude of the caregivers. According to the most recent studies the HIV-1 plays a significant role in the development of ADC particularly those with severe cognitive dysfunction. It was found that it is due to the production of the macrophages and microglia by the HIV-1, which affects the neuronal dysfunction. There is also the activation of the cytokine circuits and the neuropahtologic sequelae which causes neurotoxicity. By identifying these factors doctors may soon find effective treatment for ADC.
10173	Ainhum is a disease characterized by painful constriction of the fifth toe. This generally leads to amputation after a few years. Ainhum is more common among black African descents. It is commonly found among the blacks in West Africa, India and South America. The first recorded incidence of the disease is in 1867 by J.F. da Silva Lima. He described the disease suffered by one of the tribes in Brazil, the Nagos, who gave the disease its name. It is very rare in Europe and only a few incidences have been reported. It is also more common among those in between 20 and 50 years of age, with the average in 38 years of age. The youngest patient in record to have Ainhum is seven years old. The cause of the disease is still being studied. At present though, scientists have found that it is not caused by fungi, virus, parasite, bacteria and injury. Although it linked with walking barefoot during childhood, the disease is also found among those who have not gone barefoot. Among all the predisposing factors, race has been found to be on top of the list and thus scientists believe that it has some genetic component. Scientists believe that the disease is caused by the abnormal blood supply on the foot. Angiography of the peripheral limb has shown that the tibial artery may have become attenuated at the ankle and that there is noticeable absence of the plantar arch and branches. There are four stages of ainhum: the Grade I, wherein there is the presence of the groove; Grade II, wherein the floor of the groove is ulcerated; Grade III, wherein the bone is involved; and Grade IV wherein autoamputation occurs. In about 78% of the cases there is the presence of pain. For those in the early stage the pain may be slight and may have been caused by the pressure on the nerves. For those in the advanced stage, the pain is quite severe which is caused by chronic sepsis or fracture of the phalanx. Ainhum is commonly confused with diabetic gangrene, scleroderma, leprosy, Vohwinkle syndrome and leprosy. The pain is the symptom of the ainhum and it is a progressive condition. For the treatment of the ainhum, for the Grade I and II excision of the groove and z-plasty has been proven to relieve pain and prevent autoamputation. For the Grade III disarticulating the metatarsophanlangeal joint has been proven to be as effective.
10174	Airplane ear is the feeling of general discomfort usually experience by airplane passengers, mainly due to the rapid changes in the air pressure and altitude. People with cold, congested nose and some nasal allergy are more likely to experience airplane ears when traveling.
10175	Akathisia also spelled as acathisia from the greek word means without or not. Akathisia is characterized by restlessness. The patient is unable stay still or motionless.
10176	Akinetic mutism is the term used to describe persons who neither move nor speak.
10177	Alagille syndrome is a disease that affects the heart, liver and other major organs of the body.
10178	Alagille-Watson syndrome (AWS) is one of the genetic disorders which affect the different systems of the body including the heart and the liver. The symptoms of the AWS are usually manifested during early childhood or infancy. It is hereditary and its prevalence rate is 1 in every 70,000. The symptoms if AWS varies per family that in some cases it is so mild that the symptoms are unnoticeable while in some cases the symptoms may be as severe as to require transplantation of the heart. When the symptom is liver damage, the patient may have Alagille syndrome which includes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, xanthomas, itching and bile duct paucity. The patient may also have congenital heart problem and kidney problems. In other less common cases, the central nervous system is affected. As for the physical manifestation, those with AWS have the same facial features which includes broad forehead, small and pointed chin and deep-set eyes. The Alagille-Watson Syndrome is caused by the mutation in the JAG1 gene. This gene plays an important role in the signaling of cells during the embryonic development. The mutation of the gene then disrupts the signaling and thus it causes developmental errors of the body's system, such as the heart, liver, spinal column and facial features. In those with liver problems caused by the AWS, the bile ducts are narrowed and malformed. This then results in bile build ups and scarring which prevents the proper elimination of wastes in the blood. Usually the child inherits the altered gene from one parent although there are cases wherein the patient develops mutations of the gene. At present, there is still no known cure for the AWS and the treatment given to patients are targeted to the improvement of the affected system of the body, such as improvement of heart or liver condition. At the same time, the treatments are aimed also at reducing the effects of the affected system. For those with liver problems caused by AWS, there are several medications which are effective in improving the bile flow and in reducing the itching and this include Actigall, Atarax, Rifampicin, Cholestyramine and Phenobarbitol. Of course the effectiveness of the medication varies per patient. Doctors also recommend the high dosage of multivitamins especially vitamins A, D, E and K, since with the damage to the bile ducts the body will have difficulty absorbing these important vitamins. For those with heart defects caused by AWC, corrective surgery is sometimes necessary.
10179	The Albers-Schonberg disease is one of the most common types of osteopetrosis. It has been found that it is caused by the mutation in the CICN7 chloride channel gene. Those who have Albers-Schonberg disease, have bone cells, osteoclats, not functioning normally. These osteoclats are responsible for the breaking down of old bone tissues so that new ones will grow. In case of the disease, the osteoclats do not break the old bone tissues which then results in overgrow of the bones in the body. These overgrown then become very brittle and break easily. In the United States, it is estimated that around 1,250 persons have osteopetrosis. There are different forms of osteopetrosis and the most severe type is very rare that in the United States, there are only about 8 to 40 cases reported each year. The malignant infantile osteopetrosis is a severe form of the disease. It affects the child even when she is still in the womb. When the baby is delivered, the bones of the shoulder usually break. The baby with malignant infantile osteopetrosis has low calcium, has pressure on the optic nerve in the brain and experiences frequent bone fractures. About 75% of those affected with this disease will develop anemia and thrombocytopenia. If not treated, the child is not expected to live beyond the age of 10. Children have the disease when the parents have the abnormal genes even though they may not have the symptoms. The transient infantile osteopetrosis is the same as the infantile osteopetrosis except that in this case the patient heals on her own without treatment. The adult benign osteopetrosis is what is originally called the Albers-Schonberg disease. The disease is named after the man who first recorded or described the disease. The disease is generally mild and is more common among those in between the age of 20 and 40. One of the most common manifestations of the disease is frequent bone fractures and difficulty healing them. In some cases bone infections, degenerative arthritis, headache and pain may also be experience by those with the disease. The disease may be inherited from the parent with the defective gene and children of parents with the Albers-Schonberg disease have about 50% chance of having the same defective gene. The intermediate osteopetrosis is more common among children below the age of 10. The symptoms is almost the same as the malignant infantile osteopetrosis although less severe. It is believed that it is inherited the same way as the malignant infantile osteopetrosis.
10180	Albinism is the term used to describe a heterogeneous group that display genetically determined disorders that are generally characterized by hypopigmentation that largely affects the eyes. This group of disorders will result to little or no melanin production; hence patients don't have melanin on their skin, eyes and hair. Albinos are quite sensitive to sun exposure and at significantly more at risk of developing skin cancer.
10181	Albinism immunodeficiency is an unusual persistent disorder that involves multiple systems of the body and occurs from an alteration in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene, LYST. Because of the destruction of lysosome degranulation with phagosomes phagocytosed bacteria are not damaged by the lysosome's enzymes. Additionally, emission of lytic secretory granules in the cytotoxic T cells is also distressed. Not only doe sit happen to humans but also to cattle, blue Persian cats, white tigers and orcas.
10182	Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, otherwise known as Martin-Albright syndrome is generally a form of osteodystrophy. This is considered to be a very rare genetic disorder characterized as the body's failure t respond and recognize parathyroid hormone. This hormone is involved in taking control of phosphate and calcium in the blood vessel.
10183	In 1937, Donovan James McCune and Fuller Albright explained Albright's syndrome as an inherited condition distinguished by abnormalities in the skin pigmentation, bone ailments and endocrine complications. The diseases in the bone may result to the weakness of the bone and abnormalities in the legs, arms and skull. Diseases in the endocrine may the reason for early puberty and elevated growth rate. Patients are affected by several distinctiveness of the ailment to various degrees several individuals may have the condition and have no evident complications.
10184	Alcaptonuria is more commonly known as black urine disease, which is very rare genetic disease that can be passed on as an autosomal recessive trait. The particular gene that causes this disorder is unable to break down some proteins known as phenylalanine and tyrosine that may be toxic to the human body. This condition is harmful to the bones and body tissues.
10185	Alcohol fetopathy is characterized by a series of congenital defects that affect the facial, cranial, cardiac and nueral abnormalities. This medical condition also involves mental and physical retardation that occur on infants arising from excessive alcohol intake by the mother during pregnancy.
10186	Alcohol is commonly associated with a number of liver diseases including hepatitis. However, the relationship between alcohol hepatitis and drinking is quite complex. This is because only a small number of heavy drinkers are afflicted with alcohol hepatitis and there are some moderated drinkers who have contracted this disease. Alcohol can possibly progress to liver failure and cirrhosis if patient continues to drink and is often fatal.
10187	Alcohol-induced neurotoxicity syndrome is an acquired neurological damage caused by excessive alcohol abuse. This condition is associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and is characterized by dementia.
10188	Alcohol Poisoning is a serious - sometimes deadly - result of consuming dangerous amounts of alcohol. Excessive alcohol intake can create a direct and devastating impact on the central nervous system. Alcohol can lead to serious conditions including slowing your breathing, heart rate and gag reflex. These occurences can result to severe implications like choking, coma and even death. Alcohol poisoning is life-threatening condition that is usually brought about as a result of drinking excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages within a short period of time.
10189	Alcoholism is drinking alcoholic beverages at a level that obstruct with physical health, mental health, and social, family, or job responsibilities. It is a progressive medical condition that encourages alcohol dependency. You may be fascinated with alcohol and unable to control how much you drink.
10190	Primary aldosteronism is a medical condition, where the adrenal glands of the body produce too much of the aldosterone hormone, which causes the body lose potassium and retain sodium. In general, sodium and potassium work together to aid in maintaining the right balance of fluids in the human body, help in transmitting nerve impulses, as well as contract and relax the muscles. However, the excess in aldosterone results to sodium retention, retaining excess water and the increase of blood pressure and blood volume.
10191	Alexander disease is considered as a very rare type of neurological conditions that is known as leukodystrophies, which is a disorder results from abnormalities in myelin, the "white substance" that protects the nerve fibers in the brain. Alexander disease is progressive in nature and is usually fatal.
10192	Alien hand syndrome , also identified as Dr. Strangelove syndrome and anarchic hand is an very unusual neurological disorder, characterized by the apparent loss of control of one's hand, and the sufferer's hand appears to have a mind of its own.
10193	Alkalosis is a condition when there is a fleuid and electrolytes imbalance. In this case the base or also called alkali is in higher level. Its opposite is acidosis, which is the acid level of our body, is abnormally high.
10194	Alkaptonuria is a very rare disease that is genetically transmitted. The disease is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme called homogentisic acid oxidase. This type of deficiency often leads to the buildup of the homogentisic acide on the tissues of the body. This medical condition has been reported to be more prevalent in Dominican Republic and Slovakia.
10195	Allan-Herndon syndrome is categorized as an extremely rare hereditary disorder that causes severe mental retardation along with impaired speech ability, diminished muscle tone, as well as possible movement abnormalities. For most infants afflicted with this medical condition tend to develop normally during the first few months. However, when the child reaches more or less six months, the baby will appear weak and unable to hold up its head and may never learn to walk on their own.
10196	Allergic angiitis is also known by another medical term called Churg-Strauss syndrome, which is characterized by a restricted blood flow to the various organs. While this disease normally involves any major body organ, it usually affects the skin and the lungs. The restricted flow of blood can cause serious damage of the affected areas. The restricted flow of blood to the body organs can cause temporary or permanent damage.
10197	Allergic Asthma is a medical condition that is characterized by the episodic obstruction of bronchial reactivity and airway inflammation caused by allergies.
10198	Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillus is a serious respiratory disorder that is characterized by the allergic reaction of the lungs to a certain type of fungus. This disease occurs mostly in individuals that has cystic fibrosis and asthma, triggering cough, wheezing and in some cases accompanies by fever. If left untreated, this disorder may cause serious lung damage.
10199	Allergic cascade is the medical term used to describe a sequence of chemical release that takes place in response to allergens.
10200	Allergic Rhinitis Also called Hay Fever. Defined as an inflammation of the nasal passages, usually presents with watery nasal discharge and itching of the nose and eyes.
10201	Alopecia is the medical description for loss of hair from the body or head that sometimes lead to baldness, often unwelcome and unwanted. However, there are some individuals who display some psychological compulsion to forcibly pull out own hair. In some cases, hair loss can also present an underlying case for other medical concern such as iron deficiency.
10202	Alopecia areata is a medical condition that affects humans, characterized by excessive loss of hair in certain areas of the body, typically the scalp. This disease is often referred to as spot baldness since the initial stage causes the formation of bald spots that gradually spread through all areas of the scalp.
10203	Alopecia totalis means "loss of all hair in the head" that affects men, women and children. While the causes of alopecia totalis is still unclear, research has confirmed that this condition is an autoimmune disorder, wherein an organism fails to recognize its own parts as "self" and results in a negative response against its own tissues and cells.
10204	Alopecia Universalis, also known as "Alopecia areata universalis" is a condition that involves rapid loss of all hair, including eyelashes and eyebrows. Alopecia universalis is the most serious type of alopecia areata, affecting only 1 person in 100,000.
10205	The medical term for hair loss is called alopecia. Female alopecia is often characterized as being distressing and common. Caused by hormones, genes and aging, female pattern baldness involves a typical patter of loss of hair in women.
10206	Androgenetic alopecia or the male pattern baldness is the patterned balding of a man. One should note that the condition is not a medical disorder although it may affect both the appearance and self-esteem of some men.
10207	Named after Bernard Jacob Alpers, Alper's disease is a progressive degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system. Also called progressive sclerosing polidystrophy, progressive infantile poliodystrophy, progressive neuronal degeneration of childhood and Alpers' syndrome, this autosomal recessive disorder only occurs in infants and children, sometimes in siblings.
10208	Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, also known simply as Alpha-1 or A1AD, is a genetic disorder caused by the defective production of "alpha 1-antitrypsin". When this happens, the blood and lungs receives insufficient amounts of A1AT while the liver cells receive excess amounts of A1AT proteins. Serious cases of Alpha-1 cause emphysema in most patients with this condition. Children and adults may experience liver diseases. Treatments of this disease include intravenous A1AT protein infusions, liver or lung transplants and avoidance of dangerous inhalants. People of Iberian, Saudi Arabian and northern European ancestry are more at risk of having A1AD.
10209	Alpha-mannosidosis is an "autosomal recessive metabolic disorder" that leads to physical and mental deterioration. When the a-mannosidase enzyme becomes defective, it causes impaired cell function and sugar buildup. Since this enzyme normally helps in breaking down complex sugars, absence of this functional enzyme may lead to death on children caused by deterioration of the central nervous system.
10210	In this condition, "a thalassemias" involve genes HBA1 and HBA2, which occurs due to Mendelian inheritance in a recessive fashion. Alpha-thalassemia is also connected to the deletion of 16p chromosome. Alpha-thalassemia results in a decrease in alpha-globin production that causes a decrease in the production of alpha-globin chains. As a result, an excess of beta chains occur in adults, while an excess of gamma chains occur in newborns.
10211	Alport syndrome, which first occurred in a British family and identified by Dr. Cecil Alport in 1927, is a genetic disorder characterized by end-stage kidney disease, hearing loss and glomerulonephritis. Hematuria or the presence of blood in urine always occurs in patients with this condition. Some also develop eye problems.
10212	Alstrom syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder - one of the rarest in the world, existing in only 266 reported cases in medical books and only 411 patients in 42 countries. First described by Carl Henry Alstrom in 1959, this condition is usually mistaken with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which has resembling symptoms. However, the Bardet-Biedl syndrome usually have later onset with its symptoms.
10213	Alternating hemiplegia of childhoon or "AHC" is a rare genetic disease that causes progressive mental retardation and intermittent paralysis, which starts during childhood.
10214	Alternative names for Altitude Illness are the ff: High altitude cerebral edema; High altitude pulmonary edema; Mountain sickness; acute mountain sickness. Altitude Illness is a sickness that can influence mountain climbers, hikers, skiers, or travelers who climb very fast; usually encountered when reaching high elevation in a very rapid manner.
10215	Altophobia, or acrophobia, is a person's fear of heights. This fear can be very dangerous especially to those who are exploring high elevations; they may suddenly experience panic attack while going higher above the ground causing their heart to palpitate and lead to serious complications.
10216	(ACD) is defined as a lethal evolving anomaly of the pulmonary vasculature. It is normally illustrated as the miscarriage of the normal air-blood diffusion barrier in the newborn lung. It is usually supplementary with the misalignment of the pulmonary veins.
10217	Alveolar Hydatid Disease is a rare medical condition where there is a multi-organ infection caused by the larval stage of a Echinococcus multilocularis, tapeworm that is usually microscopic and is usually found in foxes, coyote, dogs and cats. When affecting human, the tapeworm thrive on the lungs, brain and organs of the body.
10218	Alveolar osteitis or dry socket is a type of dental condition that typically occurs when the blood clots at the area where an extracted tooth is dislodged, and exposes the underlying nerves and bones. This causes increasing pain.
10219	Alveolar soft part sarcoma or "ASPS", which was first identified in 1952, is an extremely rare type of soft tissue sarcoma, a slow-growing tumor that occurs mainly in children and young adults. ASPS is a highly angiogenic disease, which involves an intensive production of new blood vessels connecting the tumor to the blood and enabling dissemination of tumor cells into the bloodstream. Because of this, tumor cells can easily transfer into various parts of the body, usually affecting the brain and lungs. ASPS is a sarcoma that affects soft tissues that connects and supports organs and structures of the body. It usually develops in the deep soft tissues and muscles of the leg or thighs, but could also appear in hands, head and neck. However, it could also spread and develop inside bones.
10220	Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA), also known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, is an inflammation of the alveoli found in the lung. This condition is caused by hypersensitivity to various types of inhaled organic dusts. People with this disease are usually exposed to dust from their hobbies or occupations. Several types of extrinsic allergic alveolitis exist based on the provoking antigen. These include Bird-Breeder's Lung (avian proteins), Farmer's Lung (molds), Bagassosis (moldy bagasse or sugarcane), Malt Worker's Lung (moldy barley), Humidifier Lung (by mist of standing water). Mushroom Worker's Lung (mushroom compost), Compost Lung (compost), Peat Moss Worker's Lung (peat moss), Suberosis (moldy cork dust), Japanese Summer-Type HP (damp wood and mats) and Cheese-Washer's Lung (cheese casings). Other types of EAA include Hot Tub Lung, Mollusc Shell HP, Metalworking Fluids HP, Isocyanate HP, TMA HP, Beryllium and Wine-grower's Lung. The most common of all EAA are Bird-Breeder's Lung and Farmer's Lung, affecting 8 to 850 people in 100,000 persons each year for farmers alone and 6,000 to 21,000 people in 100,000 persons for pigeon breeders yearly.
10221	Alveolus Cancer is the cancer of the tiny air sacs at the end of the bronchial tubes located in the lungs.
10222	Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is a very rare form of Alzheimer's disease that affects people aged 20 to 65. This condition is inherited in an "autosomal dominant fashion". As its name suggest, Familial AD occurs in patients with 2 or more first-degree relatives with AD history. However, only 5% of the total Alzheimer's disease account to familial AD. Emil Kraepelin first identified the symptoms of FAD, while Alois Alzheimer observed the characteristic neuropathology of FAD in 1906.
10223	Alzheimer's disease, which is named after Alois Alzheimer, is a neurodegenerative disease that occurs in people aged 65 and over. This disease is the most common cause of dementia, affecting over 20 million people worldwide. Once Alzheimer's has been diagnosed, the life expectancy of patients is around 7 years. Only 3% of patients live for more than 10 years.
10224	"Amaurosis" is a Greek word that means obscure, dark or darkening. As its name suggest, Amaurosis is vision loss or a weakness that develops without any apparent lesion, affecting the eyes. Amaurosis can be a result from a medical condition, while some are acquired from excess acceleration, such as in flights.
10225	Ambiguous genitalia is a very rare medical condition in which the external genitals of the newborn do not clearly appear if it's a male or female usually because it is not properly formed. This may cause serious social stigma and question to the baby's gender. In most cases, it is important to wait to determine to true gender of the child.
10226	Amblyopia, commonly known as "lazy eye", is a visual system disorder characterized by poor vision in one of the eyes. However, the affected eye remains physically normal or out of proportion. This condition affects 1% to 5% of the global population. Poor or no transmission of the visual images to the brain causes lazy eye. This condition usually affects only one eye, but it could occur in both eyes if both are similarly deprived of clear visual images. However, if detected early in life, the chance of successful treatment increases.
10227	Ambras syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by excessive hair throughout the body. It is also known as "hypertrichosis lanuginosa", congenital hypertrichosis universalis and congenital hypertrichosis lanuginose. Ambras syndrome affects only one person in 1 billion people. Less than 40 cases of Ambras syndrome have been documented worldwide. This condition is said to have genetic component with family histories of Ambras syndrome being reported in relation to affected patients. In the 19th century, people suffering from Ambras syndrome perform in sideshow acts or circuses. People described as "wolfmen" or "werewolves" due to their excessive hair growth are most likely sufferers of Ambras syndrome.
10228	Amelogenesis is a disease that forms enamel on teeth. It occurs during the crown stage of a person's tooth development or during the formation of dentine.
10229	Amelogenesis imperfecta is a disorder of a person's tooth development, which causes teeth to become discolored, grooved, pitted, prone to breakage, become unusually small and develop other dental abnormalities. This condition produces varying effects and can affect both baby teeth and permanent teeth. Fourteen types of amelogenesis imperfecta exist. Each type is distinguished by specific dental abnormalities present. All types of amelogenesis imperfecta can affect any number of teeth. People with amelogenesis imperfecta develop teeth with abnormal color, such as grey, brown or yellow. Their teeth have greater risk of developing cavities and become hypersensitive to changes in the temperature. It is estimated that 1 in 14,000 people in the U.S. and 1 in 700 people in Sweden suffer from amelogenesis imperfecta. However, the exact incidence of this condition remains uncertain.
10230	Amenorrhoea, a term derived from the Greek "a"=negative, "men"=month, "rhoea"=flow, is a condition wherein a female does not experience a menstrual period. Amenorrhoea is also a symptom of various causes. For women where menstrual cycles never start, a condition called primary amenorrhoea, the condition may be caused by several developmental problems such as failure of ovaries to maintain or receive eggs cells as well as congenital absence of one's uterus. Delay in a female's pubertal development may also cause primary amenorrhea. Secondary amenorrhoea, wherein menstruation cycles cease, is usually caused by hormonal problems from the pituitary gland and hypothalamus. This can also occur when a female experiences premature menopause and intrauterine scar formation.
10231	American trypanosomiasis, also known as Chagas' disease, is a human parasitic disease, which occurs in tropical areas in South America. The pathogenic agent of this disease is a "flagellate protozoan" called "Trypanosoma cruzi", which is transmitted to mammals by blood-sucking assassin bugs of the Reduviidae Family. These insects are also called barbeiro, chupanca, chipo, vinchuca, benchuca and kissing bug. However, other forms of transmission are possible; some affected patients acquire the disease through fetal or blood transmission as well as ingestion of food contaminated with various parasites.
10232	Amnesia is a condition in which memory is disturbed. The generators of amnesia are organic or functional. It is the loss of recall; usually natural causes include damage to the brain, within trauma or disease, or use of specific drugs
10233	Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning is an unusual and rare disease which occurs as a result of a toxin made by a microscopic, salt-water plant that is usually red-brown or a diatom specie called Nitzchia Pungens.
10234	Amnestic Disorder, otherwise known as the Retrogade Amnesia, is a disorder where there unusually decline in memory function such as difficulty in recalling events that happened or facts that they know before the Amnestic Disorder.
10235	Amoebic dysenery is an intestinal illness due to a microscopic parasite called Entamoeba histolytica. Anyone can be infected with Entamoeba histolytica. It is common to people living in tropical or subtropical areas and men fun of having sex with men.
10236	Amputation is the removal of a body extremity by trauma or surgery. It is implemented to control pain or a disease, such as malignancy or gangrene. A special case is the congenital amputation, where foetal limbs have been taken off by constrictive bands. Amputation of the hands or feet is implemented as a form of punishment for people who committed crimes in some countries.
10237	Amyloidosis is a unique and potentially deadly disease that takes place when substances called amyloid proteins build up in your organs; which areabnormal proteins commonly formed by cells in your bone marrow that can be deposited in any tissue or organ.
10238	Amylotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that destroys the motor neurons causing paralysis and eventual death. In this condition the nerves associated with voluntary muscle control degenerate and results to atrophy of the muscles. Most patients become bound to a wheelchair and soon die due to other complications.
10239	Amyoplasia congenita is a birth disorder characterized by stiffness of the joints and muscle and nerve wastage that causes severe impairment and eventual immobility of the arms and legs.
10240	abbreviated ALS; is a disorder of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that are in charge for voluntary muscle movement. It is a crucial neurological disease that harms the nerve cells that control voluntary muscles.
10241	Anal cancer is a type of cancer which arises from the anus, the distal orifice of the gastrointestinal tract.
10242	Anal exudates are wastes, either in fluid or semi-solid form, which are released by the anus. They also referred to as feces.
10243	An anal fissure is a small tear in the lining of the anal canal. Frequently in infants' ages 6 to 24 months, anal fissures are less likely to develop in older children. Adults may generate anal fissures as a result of passing hard or large stools during bowel movements.
10244	Anal itching is characterized by an intense itching felt around the anus causing extreme discomfort. This medical condition is also called pruritus ani and can be caused by a number of irritants such as abrasion of the clothing, moisture or even pressure in sitting.
10245	Anaphylactic Shock is also called Anaphylaxis. It is a life-threatening type of allergic reaction in humans and other mammals. It occurs when an allergic response triggers a rapid release from mast cells of huge quantities of immunological mediators leading to systemic vasodilation and edema of bronchial mucosa. Anaphylactic shock can advance to death in a count of minutes if left untreated. Anaphylactic Shock may occur after ingestion, injection of an allergen, skin contact or, in rare cases, inhalation.
10246	Anaphylactoid Purpura otherswise known as the Henoch-Schonlein purpura or HSP is a medical condition that refers to the inflammation of the blood vessels or the vasculitis.
10247	Anaphylaxis, from the Greek words "ava ana" (against) and "phylaxis" (protection), is a severe type I hypersensitivity and acute systemic allergic reaction in mammals, including humans. This condition occurs when an animal or person is exposed to an allergen that has already become sensitized. Large amounts of this allergen may cause a life-threatening reaction. Anaphylaxis occurs after injection, ingestion and inhalation of an allergen. In the United States, 1% to 17% of the population is estimated at risk for experiencing an anaphylactic reaction if exposed in various allergens, especially insect stings and penicillin. Of those who suffer from Anaphylaxis, 1% die as a result, accounting to 1,000 deaths per year in the United States.
10248	Anaplastic thyroid cancer is a type of thyroid cancer that has an extremely poor prognosis with only 14% survival rate. This disease is known for its aggressive behavior and fatal resistance to available cancer treatments. Anaplastic thyroid cancer quickly invades surrounding tissues.
10249	Anasarca, also called Swelling is the enlargement of skin, organs or other body parts. It is caused by build up of liquid in the tissues. The extra fluid can advance to a quick upsurge in weight over a short period of time. Anasarca can occur throughout the body or only in a definite part of the body.
10250	Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is also called Androgen resistance syndrome. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a condition wherein patients suffer from a set of disorders related to sexual differentiation, which results in mutation of the genes encoding the androgen receptor. The nature of problems caused by Androgen insensitivity syndrome varies largely according to the sensitivity and structure of abnormal receptor. Almost all types of Androgen insensitivity syndrome involve infertility and undervirilization in persons of both genders. Women with complete Androgen insensitivity syndrome have female appearance even if they have an undescended testes and 46XY karyotype.
10251	Anemia comes from the Greek words "an-hama", which means "without blood". Anemia is the most widespread blood disorder. This condition is a deficiency of RBCs (red blood cells) or hemoglobin, the molecules inside RBCs. When hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs into tissues, anemia causes lack of oxygen in organs. When this happens, different clinical consequences may occur due to oxygen deficiency. There are three classes of anemia - excessive blood loss, excessive blood cell destruction and deficient production of red blood cells. Anemia has several types, which are produced by various underlying causes. This disease can be classified using different ways, normally based on discernible clinical spectra, the morphology of red blood cells and etiologic mechanisms.
10252	Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a congenital erythroid aplasia, which is commonly present in infants. Patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia have anemia (or low red blood cell counts). However, the remaining blood cells, such as white blood cells and platelets, have normal counts. Various congenital abnormalities may also occur with Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients.
10253	Pernicious anemia, also called "Addisson's anemia" or "Biermer's anaemia", is a type of megalobastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. This condition is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in adults.
10254	Sideroblastic anemia is a condition caused by the abnormal production of red blood cells, normally as a part of myelodysplastic syndrome that can evolve into hematological malignancies, such as acute myelogenous leukemia. When this happens, the patient's body will have iron, but it cannot incorporate this into the hemoglobin.
10255	Anencephaly is a cephalic disorder resulting from a neural tube defect, which occurs when the head of the neural tube does not close. It usually occurs around the 23rd to 26th day of pregnancy. This condition results in the absence of a large portion of the scalp, skull and brain. Infants with Anencephaly are born with no forebrain, the part of the brain where the cerebral hemispheres should be present. The brain tissues that exist are often uncovered by skin or bone. Infants born with Anencephaly are usually deaf, blind, unconscious and inability to feel pain. This is because the cerebral hemispheres affected by this condition are responsible for higher level of cognition, such as thinking. In the United States, 1,000 to 2,000 babies are born with Anencephaly every year. Female babies are more likely to be affected by Anencephaly. Unfortunately, the cause of Anencephaly is unknown.
10256	An aneurysm is a localized, balloon-like, blood-filled dilation of any blood vessel, which is caused by a disease or weakening of the vessel wall. An aneurysm usually occurs in arteries located in the brain and in the aorta (heart). The bulge in blood vessels could burst, which could lead to death any time. However, the larger aneurysm becomes, the larger chances it is to burst.
10257	Aneurysm of sinus Valsalva, also known as "aneurysm of the aortic sinus" is a rare disorder, affecting only one person in 1,000 people. For people with Aneurysm of sinus Valsalva, it usually occurs in the right sinus, rarely in the left. Aneurysm of sinus Valsalva is a congenital disease and may possibly be associated with heart defects. This condition is sometimes associated with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and Marfan Syndrome. It could also result from syphilis, chest injuries, atherosclerosis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, infective endocarditis and cystic medial necrosis. When Aneurysm of sinus Valsalva is unruptured, it can be asymptomatic. As such, the condition may go undetected until symptoms become apparent or medical imaging is performed.
10258	Angelman syndrome is a hereditary disorder that causes developmental disabilities and neurological problems, such as balancing and walking, and difficulty speaking. Regular smiles and outbursts of laughter are common for people with Angelman syndrome, and many have happy, excitable personalities.
10259	Angina pectoris is a type of chest pain or discomfort that is primarily caused by reduction of the blood flow to the heart muscle. This medical condition is categorized as a coronary artery disease.
10259	Angina Pectoris is a term that illustrates chest pain due to myocardial ischemia. It normally happens on exertion and is comforted by resting. Alternative names for Angina Pectoris are stable angina and chronic angina.
10260	Unstable angina, or angina pectoris, is a medical condition where the obstruction of the coronary artery causes reduced supply of oxygen to the heart.
10261	Angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia is more commonly known as the Castleman's disease, which is categorized as a very rare form of illness that primarily affects the lymph nodes as well as other immune-cell structures of the body.
10262	It is important to discuss lipoma to understand the nature of angiolipoma. Lipoma is a benign tumor composed of fatty tissues. These tumors are usually movable, soft to touch and painless. They could grow extremely slow and can sometimes be cancerous. Most types of lipomas are small, but can increase its size up to six centimeters. Lipoma usually occurs in adults aged 40 to 60, but could also appear in children. An estimated 1% of the global population suffers from lipoma. Lipomas are also seen in animals. They are found usually on older dogs, but lipomas can also occur in puppies. They appear in single or multiple. While these lipomas grow, they are usually benign. Malignant forms of lipoma in animals are extremely rare.
10263	Angioma is a benign tumor, which is made up of small blood vessels. Angioma normally appears near or at the surface of the skin in any part of the body. However, Angiomas are usually not considered dangerous (depending on location). Some Angiomas are present as symptoms for other serious diseases, such as cirrhosis. When an angioma is removed, it is usually for cosmetic reasons.
10264	Angiomatosis is a condition that refers to "little knots" of capillaries in different organs. Angiomatosis tend to be defined, sponge-like, sharp tumors that are composed of dilated and large cavernous vascular spaces. Angiomatosis often appears in people with Sturge-Weber syndrome, Bacillary angiomatosis, Von-Hippel-Lindau disease and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome.
10265	Angiopathy refers to any disease associated with the blood vessels or the lymph vessels. When angiopathy is caused by diabetes, it is called diabetic angiopathy. Similar to most complications brought about by diabetes, diabetic angiopathy is primarily due to hyperglycemia or the high levels of blood sugar known to us as glucose. This disease can occur in any part of the body where the effect of high glucose level resulted to clogged up due to build up of plaque in the inner walls of the vessels. There are two types of this disease, macroangiopathy or microangiopathy.
10266	Angiosarcoma is a cancerous tumor that develops from the blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. Such tumors could occur in any part of the body, but they mostly appear in the neck, head, legs and arms.
10267	Anguillulosis is a parasitosis caused by roundworm. It affects over 50 million people worldwide, occurring mainly in sub-tropical and tropical zones, such as South East Asia, West Indies, Indian Ocean region, Southern Africa and Central & South America. The female roundworm, measuring only 2.55 long, lives in the small intestines of humans. When they lay eggs in the small intestines, they release larvae in their feces. These roundworms reach infectious stage directly after sexual reproduction. When they become infectious, roundworms penetrate skin directly. They could also affect the digestive system and may produce symptoms 30 years after roundworms are reproduced.
10268	A chronic inflammatory condition of the corners of the mouth is called angular cheilitis or perleche. It is usually associated with a bacterial (Staphylococcal) or fungal (Candidal) infection, and those infected may also have thrush (an oral candidiasis). Depending upon whether or not the affected person seeks treatment, the condition can last from days to months.
10269	Anhidrosis is the inability to sweat normally that can eventually lead to overheating of the body which can be very fatal. Anhidrosis can be quite difficult to diagnose and often goes unrecognized. There are a number of factors that can cause this medical condition and treatment would usually depend on the underlying cause.
10270	Aniridia is an extremely rare congenital disease characterized by an underdevelopment of the patient's iris, which usually occur in both eyes. This condition is associated with very poor development of the retina at the back of the eye, which in turn, prevents normal vision development..
10271	Anisakiasis is a condition caused by an infection from Anisakis worms of the genus parasitic nematodes. These nematodes have a life cycle that involves marine mammals and various fishes. When fishes are infected with Anisakis, it could produce an "Anaphylactic reaction" in people sensitized to IgE (immunoglobulin) Anisakiasis usually occurs in areas where fish is consumed raw, salted or lightly pickled. The highest number of people with Anisakiasis is Japan (consuming sushi), Scandinavia (due to cod liver), South America (after eating ceviche) and Netherlands (from infected fermented herrings).
10272	Anisometropia is a medical condition where it affects the binocular vision of a person especially that of infants and children. It is characterized by having Non-symmetric vision or eyes that have unequal and different refractive power which causes varying or unequal rotations leading to diplopia and asthenopia.
10273	An ankle fracture is a quite common injury, especially among athletes. There are three bones on each ankle joint, each one is susceptible to stubbing, twisting, stress and trauma. The degree of the severity of an ankle fracture varies from one case to another, ranging from mild to severe such as shattering the bones into tiny pieces.
10274	An ankle sprain may be due to a sudden twist or roll of the ankle or any unnatural movement that stretched the ligaments of the ankle. The ligaments are tough elastic bands that connects a bone to another as well ass help stabilize the joints to prevent any excessive movements.
10275	Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic degenerative inflammatory arthritis that affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, causing a painful and eventual fusion of the spine. When complete fusion occurs and results in complete spine rigidity, it becomes a condition known as "bamboo spine".
10276	Ankylosis is a condition characterized by joint stiffness caused by an injury or a disease. The rigidity of joints may be partial or complete. Some cases of Ankylosis may be due to the inflammation of the muscular (tendinous) structures in the outer part of the joints or of the joint's tissues itself.
10277	Ankylostomiasis, derived from the Greek words "anclo" (crooked or bent) and "stoma" (mouth), is the disease caused by hookworms. It is also known as tunnel disease, Egyptian chlorosis, Miner's anemia, helminthiasis and Brickmaker's anaemia. Ankylostomiasis is a condition caused by large numbers of hookworms present that produce iron deficiency anemia by aggressively sucking blood from its host's intestinal walls. Hookworm is the leasing cause of child and maternal morbidity in areas of the tropics and subtropics. In children, Ankylostomiasis could cause growth retardation, prematurity, intellection and cognitive retardation, intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight for newborns with infected mothers. Ankylostomiasis is rarely fatal, but severe anemia could be present with patients heavily infected with the disease.
10278	Annular pancreas is an extremely rare condition that occurs in 1 out of 15,000 newborns. Annular pancreas is a condition wherein the second part of the "duodenum" is surrounded by pancreatic tissues that continue up to the head of the pancreas. This part of the pancreas constricts the duodenum and impairs or blocks the flow of food to the intestines.
10279	Ano-rectal atresia is a birth defect characterized by a malformed rectum due to an unknown cause. This condition is commonly present along with other types of birth defects such as heart and spinal problems, renal and limb anomalies, tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia. Ano-rectal atresia is sometimes a complication of sacrococcygeal teratoma. There are several forms of Ano-rectal atresia. Sometimes the colon remains close to the skin (low lesion), which can be caused by narrowing of the anus or missing anus with the rectum ending in a pouch. Other types are characterized with a high lesion, wherein the colon is located high in the pelvis, while the fistula connects the rectum with the vagina, urethra or bladder. Some patients suffer from a joined vagina and colon into a single channel, a disorder called persistent cloaca. To confirm the type of Ano-rectal atresia, sonography is recommended. Ano-rectal atresia occurs in 1 in 5,000 newborns. It affects both boys and girls. However, Ano-rectal atresia will be present as the low version 90% in females and 50% in males.
10280	Anodontia, also known as anodontia vera in dentistry, is a very rare genetic disorder. This disease is characterized by congenital absence of all permanent and primary teeth. Anodontia is associated with a group of nerve and skin syndromes known as "ectodermal dysplasias". Anodontia is commonly part of different syndromes, which rarely occur as an isolated disorder. Partial anodontia, wherein the patient suffers from congenital absence of two or more teeth, could also occur. This is also known as "oligodontia" and "hypodontia". Some patients may also suffer from congenital absence of all third molars and all wisdrom teeth.
10281	Anonychia Microcephaly is a neurological disorder characterized by a small head circumference, widely spaced teeth, clinodactyly of 5th finger and the absence of nails. This condition may be congenital. However, some cases develop during the first years of life. Anonychia Microcephaly may be caused by various conditions that result in chromosomal abnormalities or an abnormal growth of the brain. Infants with Anonychia Microcephaly are born with a reduced head size. As the child grows, his or her head size fails to grow while their faces continue to develop normally, resulting in a small head with receding forehead and loose scalp. When the child grows older, the size of the skull becomes more obvious even if the entire body became dwarfed or underweight.
10282	Anophthalmia is the congenital absence of one or both eyes. Its name is derived from the Greek word "anophthalmos", meaning "without eye". Primary or True Anophthalmia is extremely rare. True Anophthalmia occurs when complete absence of the ocular tissue inside the orbit is diagnosed. When this condition occurs, a small globe becomes present inside the orbital soft tissue, which is usually not visibly in the initial examination. Extreme microphtalmos is more commonly seen.
10283	Anopthalmia is a congenital disorder in which a child is born with only one or totally no eyes. The occurrence of this defect is very rare. In this condition, there only is a small white mass present in the ocular cavity; but the mass contains no vision abilities. Treatment for this disease requires surgery.
10284	Anorchia is a medical condition wherein both testes are not present at birth. Anorchia is also known as congenital anorchia, vanishing testes syndrome, vanishing testes, empty scrotum and testicular regression syndrome (TRS). During the first few weeks of fertilization, the embryo needs to develop rudimentary sex organs that are very important to the development of the reproductive system. In human males, if their sex organs do not develop within the first 8 weeks, they will develop female genitalia. When the testes are lost between 8 to 10 weeks, they will develop "ambiguous genitalia" at birth. However, when the testes are lost after fourteen weeks, the baby can develop a normal, male reproductive system, but without testes. People with Anorchia have a 46-XY chromosome constellation. Signs of Anorchia include lack of secondary sex characteristics and an empty scrotum.
10285	Anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric disorder that describes an eating disorder, which is characterized by body image distortion and low body weight due to an obsessive fear of becoming fat or gaining weight. People with anorexia nervosa usually control their body weight by voluntary vomiting, purging, starving, extreme exercise and other weight control measures, such as taking diuretic drugs and diet pills. It usually affects adolescent females and only 10% of anorexia nervosa patients are male. Anorexia nervosa is an extremely complex disorder, involving neurobiological, sociological and psychological components.
10286	Anorgasmia is a medical term to refer to the regular difficulty of reaching reaching orgasm especially even after ample sexual stimulation and causing personal distress. Anorgasmia is actually a very common occurrence with about 15 percent of women report such cases of experiencing difficulty in reaching orgasm.
10287	Anosmia is a condition wherein patients experience the loss of temporary or permanent ability to smell. Hyposmia is a related condition wherein patients experience a decrease in their ability to smell, while "hyperosmia" is a condition that causes an increase in the patient's ability to smell. However, when a person loses his sense of smell for a particular odor, he is suffering from a genetically based disorder called "specific anosmia". "Congenital Anosmia" refers to the condition wherein a person is born without the sense of smell. Anosmia can be associated with other conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, zinc deficiency, cadmium poisoning, allergies, Refsum disease, holoprosencephaly, Alzheimer's disease, Kallman syndrome and Parkinson's disease.
10288	Anovolution is a medical condition where by there is difficulty in ovulating thereby causing infertility. The ovary in this kind of medical condition fails to release egg which make her unable to conceive.
10289	Anoxia is a medical condition where there is lack of oxygen in the body to supply it to the person's organ tissues. It is also known as hypoxia inasmuch as they refer to same condition where there is not enough oxygen needed to supply the organ tissues of the body.
10290	Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries are extreme stretching and tearing of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee, which can either be complete or partial.
10291	Anterior horn disease is a condition that affects the anterior horn cells, which are responsible for voluntary muscle activities, such as breathing, walking, swallowing and speaking. Anterior horn disease is characterized by the death of more neurons, which result in a prolonged and progressive motor weakness. Some patients with anterior horn disease are affected permanently.
10292	Anterior knee pain syndrome is a degeneration of the tissue that protects the knee cap. This disease features extreme pain on the knees and is usually felt by people who are into athletic sports.
10293	Anthrax is an acute disease in animals and humans, which is caused by the bacterium "bacillus anthracis". Some types of anthrax are highly lethal. There are 89 types of anthrax recorded. Unlike other types of bacteria, anthrax can form long-lived spores. As soon as the life cycle of the bacteria is threatened by various factors, such as temperature change of dying host, the bacteria can transform into dormant spores, wait for another host and transfer to continue their life cycle. Anthrax usually occurs in wild and grass-eating mammals that breathe or ingest in the spores while eating grass. This disease can also be caught by humans exposed to dead infected pigs, high amounts of anthrax spores in animal wool, fur or hide and tissues from infected animals. While anthrax cannot be spread directly from one person to the next, human clothing can transfer the spores and when an infected person dies and the body is buried.
10294	Antibiotic resistance is the capability of a microorganism to resist the effects of antibiotics. It is a particular type of drug resistance. It develops naturally via natural selection that acts upon arbitrary mutation but it can also be developed by applying an evolutionary stress on a population.
10295	Antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis, also known as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, is a kind of TB that doesn't respond effectively to anti-TB drugs such as rifampicin and isoniazid. This type of the disease is one of the deadliest forms of tuberculosis. It is less transmissible however, but it also needs special kinds of drugs that can eliminate antibiotic-resistant agents that thrive in the body. Most of the time treatment takes years to complete; some patients meanwhile die due to failure of completing the treatment.
10296	Antibiotic-associated diarrhea typically occurs when the natural balance of bad and good bacteria in the intestinal tract is disturbed. This causes the harmful bacteria to proliferate resulting to frequent bowel movements. Often, it is mild and can clears up after several days or less.
10297	Antibiotic-caused colitis is an infectious disease affecting the colon. Like the typical colitis, it is caused by C. difficile, which is also present among individuals who are taking antibiotic treatment. This infection commonly occurs in hospitals.
10298	Antimicrobial resistance refers to the ability of bacteria to resist the effects of certain drugs. In this case some bacterial infections become difficult to treat since doctors have to search for a new antidote to treat diseases. Antimicrobial resistance can lead to more serious diseases such as bacteremia, where the bacteria have contaminated the blood.
10299	Antiphospholipid syndrome, simply called "APLS" or "APS", is a disorder of coagulation, which causes pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia, miscarriage and preterm deliver. It also causes blood clots in both veins and arteries. The syndrome occurs because of the production of antibodies against phosphilipids. This disorder is characterized by antibodies against B2 glycoprotein I and cardiolipin. Antiphospholipid syndrome is usually seen in conjunction with other autoimmune-related diseases. In some cases, Antiphospholipid syndrome can lead to high risk of death and dramatic organ failure caused by generalized thrombosis.
10300	Antisocial personality disorder (APD) is a mental disorder characterized by a persistent pattern and violation of and disregard for the rights of others, which begin in early childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood. Features of Antisocial personality disorder include manipulation and deceit.
10301	Antithrombin is a small protein molecule, which is responsible for inactivating several enzymes of the coagulation system. It consists of 432 amino acids and contains 3 disulfide bonds as well as 4 possible "glycosylation" sites. The role of antithrombin in regulating normal blood coagulation is demonstrated by the relationship between acquired and inherited antithrombin deficiencies. This relationship is also seen in the increased risk of developing thrombotic disease. Antithrombin deficiency usually appears to patient with recurrent pulmonary embolism and venous thrombosis.
10302	Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic defect caused by an abnormal production of alpha-1 antitrypsin, a protein that thrives in the liver cells. The lack of this protein may cause severe disorders in the different organs and weakness of the immune system.
10303	Anton syndrome, also known as "Anton's blindness" and "Anton-Babinski syndrome", is a very rare symptom of brain damage that occurs in the occipital lobe. Anton-Babinski syndrome is named after Gabriel Anton and Joseph Babinski. Individuals who suffer from Anton syndrome are considered "cortically blind", but insist they are capable of seeing even with evidence of their blindness. Blindness is usually dismissed by the suffered of Anton syndrome through confabulation. This type of symptom is commonly seen after a stroke, but could also occur after experiencing head injury. Anton syndrome can be caused by damage in the portion of the brain responsible for detecting the absence or presence of vision or damages to the part of the brain responsible for eyesight.
10304	Anuria otherswise known as the Anuresis is a medical condition where there is inability to urinate because of the kidney failed to function or due to diseases like kidney stones.
10305	Aortic aneurysm is a general term referring to the swelling of the aorta, usually caused by an underlying weakness in the aorta's wall. Although stretched vessels may only cause discomfort, aortic aneurysm may result in rupture, which causes massive internal hemorrhage, severe pain and a quick death if not treated promptly.
10306	Aortic arch interruption, also commonly known as "interrupted aortic arch", is an extremely rare heart defect wherein the aorta did not complete its development - did not form a complete tube or the aorta has a hole in the muscle wall. As such, patients with an aortic arch interruption have a gap between the descending and ascending thoracic aorta. Majority of patients with this condition have other cardiac-related anomalies, such as bicuspid aortic valve, truncus arteriosus, aortic stenosis or ventricular septal defects. As such, treatment of aortic arch interruption would depend on the presence of any of the associated defects.
10307	Aortic coarctation is a condition characterized by narrowing of the aorta in an area where the "ductus arteriosus" inserts. There are three types of aortic coarctation - preductal, ductal and postductal coarctation. In preductal coarctation, the narrowing is near the ductus arteriosus. Severe cases of preductal coarctation, blood flow to the lower body to the narrowing could become dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus. When this happens, its closure can become life threatening and lead to hypoplastic development of the aorta. In ductal coarctation, the narrowing occurs along the insertion of the "ductus arteriosus". This type of condition usually develops when the ductus arteriosus closes. In postductal coarctation, the narrowing is far from the instertion of the ductus arteriosus. Newborns with this type of aortic coarctation may become critically sick after birth. Ductal aortic coarctation is more common in adults and is associated with hypertension, weak pulses in lower extremeties and notching of the ribs.
10308	Aortic dissection is a condition wherein the wall of the aorta tears, causing blood to flow between the layers of the aorta wall and forcing the layers apart. Aortic dissection is a life threatening condition and is considered as a medical emergency because it could lead to a quick death even with appropriate treatments. If the dissection tears the aorta through all its three layers, rapid and massive blood loss would occur. Aortic dissection that result in rupture have 80% mortality rate. Almost 50% of patients with aortic dissention die before they reach the hospital.
10309	Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a fixed form of congenital left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction that arises as a localized or a diffuse narrowing of the ascending aorta beyond the superior margin of the sinuses of Valsalva. It is responsible for less than 7% of all fixed forms of congenital LVOT obstructive lesions. SVAS may arise sporadically, as a manifestation of elastin arteriopathy, or as part of Williams syndrome (also known as Williams-Beuren syndrome), a genetic disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance.
10310	Aortic valve regurgitation is also known as aortic incompetence or insufficiency. This medical condition occurs when the heart's aortic valve does not close tightly, causing some of the blood to that has been pumped out to leak back. This leakage will result to preventing the heart to supply blood to the rest of the body, causing the patient to always feel tired and short of breath.
10311	Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a "valvular" heart disease caused by the incomplete opening of the aortic valve. Normally, the aortic valves control the direction of blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. When the aortic valve is in good working condition, it does not obstruct the flow of blood. Aortic valve stenosis is a common disorder, affecting about 2% of individuals over 65 years old, 3% of patients over 75 and 4% of people over 85 years old. Since the global population is aging, the prevalence of Aortic valve stenosis is increasing.
10312	Apert syndrome is a congenital disorder commonly known as "acrocephalosyndactyly". This disorder is classified as a "branchial arch syndrome", which affects the first branchial arch, responsible for the maxilla and mandible. Apert syndrome causes lasting and widespread effects to individuals because branchial arches are important in the fetus development.
10313	Aphasia is a language disorder resulting from damage to segments of the brain that are responsible for language; usually on the left brain hemisphere. It often occurs all of a sudden usually as a result of stroke or head injury. In some cases, it progresses gradually. In both cases, the result is remarkable impairment in writing, reading, expression and language understanding
10314	Aphthous stomatitis is a form of mouth ulcer that presents a painful open sore within the mouth, which is caused by a break in the patient's mucous membrane. Also known as aphthous ulcer or "Sutton's disease", the term "aphtha" means ulcer. Aphthous stomatitis is characterized by repeated painful discrete areas of ulceration. Recurrent Aphthous stomatitis (RAD) is distinguished from other diseases by their multiplicity, chronicity and tendency to recur. RAD is one of the most common oral diseases, accounting to 10% of the population. Females are more affected by Aphthous stomatitis than men are. However, over 35% of patients with RAD have a family history of this disease.
10315	Aphthous ulcers are more commonly known as canker sores. These are characterized by the development of small and shallow lesions on the soft tissues in your mouth, under the tongue, or insides of the cheeks or lips, as well as at the base of the gums. Often , it will usually go away naturally after a few weeks or so.
10316	Apiphobia is the fear of bees or bee stings, a common phobia among people. Derived from the Latin words "apis" for honeybee, Apiphobia is a specific phobia - an abnormal fee of bees. Apiphobia is a type of zoophobia common in young children, which could prevent them from participating in any activities outdoors. Older people with Apiphobia can control this fear more easily. However, a few cases of Apiphobia in adults, such as Adam Savage of MythBusters, may show extreme fear of bees. One method of overcoming Apiphobia in children is to train them in facing their fears.
10317	Aplastic anemia is a condition wherein the bone marrow does not produce enough new cells to replenish the blood cells. The word "aplastic" refers to the marrow that suffers from aplasia, making it unable to function normally. Anemia is the disorder that results in having lesser red blood cells than normal, which are needed to function properly. Although anemia refers to low levels of red blood cells, Aplastic anemia differs due to the lower counts of all blood cell types - platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells.
10318	Apnea is a condition that is characterized by the sudden or spontaneous loss of breathing for 20 seconds or more. Infantile apnea, as its name suggest, occurs in children under 1 year old.
10319	Postanesthetic apnea is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by sensitivity to any anesthetic agents, particularly those derived from drugs like choline. When a person with sleep apnea is administered with anesthetic drugs, the muscles responsible for lung function become paralyzed.
10320	Apocrine duct Occlusion, commonly known as the Fox-Fordyce disease, is an uncommon skin disorder, affecting male and children, but is more common in women between 13 and 35 years old. This condition is characterized by the sudden development of itchy bumps usually around hair follicles of nipples, underarm areas and pubic region.
10321	Apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) is a potentially fatal genetic disorder and autosomal recessive cause of hypokalaemia, prenatal and postnatal growth failure, undetectable levels of aldosterone and renin and hypertension, which responds to treatments using glucocorticoid. Apparent mineralocorticoid excess is an extremely rare disorder, accounting to only 60 patients recorded for the past 20 years. Apparent mineralocorticoid excess is a result of mutations of the HSD11B2 gene, which is responsible for encoding the kidney isozyme "11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase". This isozyme inactivates the circulating cortisol to the less-active metabolite cortisone, which leads to an elevated amount of cortisol in the kidney. Note that high concentrations of cortisol could activate the "mineralocorticoid receptor", which leads to an aldosterone-like effect in the patient's kidneys. This occurrence causes hypernatremia, hypokalemia and hypertension. Apparent mineralocorticoid excess can also be caused by licorice ingestion, which blocks 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and increase cortisol activity. Early and aggressive treatment of Apparent mineralocorticoid excess can prevent and improve the mortality and morbidity of end-organ damage rates. Diagnosis is made by DNA and hormonal analysis.
10322	Appendicitis, also known as epityphlitis, is a condition wherein an inflammation of the appendix occurs. Although mild cases of appendicitis can be resolved without any treatment, most require removal of the appendix.
10323	Apple peel syndrome, also known as Jejunal Atresia, is an extremely rare genetic disorder wherein patients are born without a small part of the fold from the stomach membrane connecting the small intestines to the abdomen. This condition occurs in 1 of 270 babies born alive. It is the most common intestinal obstruction found in one third of all babies.
10324	Apraxia is a neurological disorder that is characterized by the loss of ability to carry out or execute learned movements, such as speech, despite having the physical ability and desire to perform such movements.
10325	An apudoma is any endocrine tumor that arises from an APUD cell (APUD, meaning amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation) properties. These cells, which are derived from neural crest cells, are from structures such as the prostate, pancreas and ampulla of Vater. First identified in 1975, Apudoma is a very general term. As such, most doctors and scientists prefer to use a more specific term when possible, such as apudoma of gall bladder.
10326	Arachnitis, commonly known as Arachnoiditis, is a severe condition characterized by intense stinging, burning pain and various neurological problems, which could lead to scarring, irritation and blinding of blood vessels ad its nerve roots.
10327	This disease is also known as "spider fingers" or archromachia. It is referred to as "spider fingers" due to the fact that the fingers are slim and long comparing it to the palm like a spider's legs. This disease can occur after birth or later in life. This disease can happen without any medical conditions but sometimes it is related with some medical condition for instance Marfan Syndrome. Other term for this disease is Dolichostenomelia.
10328	Contractural Beals Type Arachnodactyly is a very rare genetic disorder also known as Beals Syndrome. It is characterized by permanently flexed fingers, abnormally shaped ears and the permanent fixation of affected joints like hips, fingers, knees and elbows that is in a flexed position.
10329	It is an uncommon disease which involves cysts that are fluid-filled that forms in the arachnoid membrane that is a thin layer of tissue that creates a membrane that covers the brain and the spinal cord It can start during childhood or can come later during adulthood. The determination of the severity of the disease is based on the location of the cyst and how big it is.
10330	Arachnoidal Fibroblastoma, commonly known as Meningioma, is a tumor of the meninges, a part of the brain that protects the spinal cord and brain. This condition can develop in any part of the spinal cord or brain, but usually start in the cerebral hemispheres. Most Arachnoidal Fibroblastoma are benign, but malignant types of this condition occur. This condition accounts to one in every five brain tumors and is mostly found in middle-aged adults.
10331	A disease due to the swelling of the arachnoids which is a membrane that encloses and shields the central nervous system nerves together with the spinal cord and the brain. The swelling can be caused by infections due to viruses or bacteria and can also be caused by chemical irritation. The swelling may cause creation of scar tissue and bonding that results the nerves on the spine to "bond". The disease is usually progressive and treatments differ in its efficiency, the disease is not often cured.
10332	An error of metabolism that is inherent is known as Arakawa's syndrome II. A hereditary disorder caused by the absence of the enzyme tetrahydrofolate-methyltransferase. People who has this disease cannot properly digest methylcobalamin a kind of Vitamin B12. Other terms for this disease are Methionine synthase deficiency, N5-methylhomocysteine transferase deficiency and Tetrahydrofolate-methyltransferase deficiency syndrome.
10333	Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a condition in which a patient with underlying disease has a breathing problem. It is a non- specific respiratory disorder that occurs if there is a fluid build up in the lungs that blocks the exchange of gases that provide energy in the body. ARDS is a life threatening disease if failed to provide care immediately and properly.
10334	Aregenetive anemia is a type of anemia in which the bone marrow drastically reduces its production of blood cells. It is a rare but serious condition that can be life-threatening.
10335	ARG deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that is shown by a lack of the arginase enzyme. This enzyme plays a big role in removing nitrogen from the body, and insufficient amounts of arginase can lead to nitrogen poisoning in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Effects of nitrogen contamination include mental retardation, spasticity and mental retardation. ARG deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder.
10336	A hereditary disorder, that causes high level of arginine in the blood. Death is the result for total deficiency while partial deficiency causes hyperammonemia, metabolic alkalosis, convulsions, hepatomegaly, mental retardation and failure to grow.
10337	Argininosuccinic aciduria, also referred to as argininosuccinic academia, an inborn condition that results to ammonia being accumulated in the urine and the blood. In the earlier days of life it becomes evident, take note that ammonia is toxic particularly in the nervous system. A lack of argininosuccinate lyase enzyme, which is required to get rid of nitrogen from the body, causes ammonia to build up in the blood and urine. A baby infected with argininosuccinic aciduria can appear exhausted and be reluctant to eat, with poorly-controlled breathing rate or body temperature, occurrence of seizures or abnormal body movements, or worse might result to coma.
10338	An intake of elemental silver, silver dust or silver compounds, over exposure to silver salts - typically industrial exposure or medication causes Argyria. The most evident symptom if Argyria is that the skin turns to blue or bluish-grey colored. Argyria may start as generalized or local Argyria. A condition that is related to the eye is called Argyrosis. It is believed that the disorder can be permanent but laser therapy is helpful.
10339	A broken arm is a very common injury that both occur in children and adult. A fracture would usually require immediate medical attention and surgery to realign the bone.
10340	Ocassionally it is called as Chiari II malformation or ACM, it is is a hereditary deformity of the brain. It is an unusual deformity where the support of the brain goes through the upper spinal canal. This disorder happens to approximately every child born with both spina bifida and hydrocephalus. Chiari malformations I, II and III is associated with the apparent irregularity of the hindbrain which was described by German pathologist Hans Chiari in the late 1800's. Afterwards, further investigators supplemented a fourth (Chiari IV) malformation. The severity scale is rated I - IV, with IV as the most severe. Arnold Chiari Malformation particularly refers to the Chiari II malformation.
10341	Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an genetic cardiac muscle disorder characterized by a damaged muscle that can be gradually replaced by fat and scar tissue. This serious heart disease is one of the highly recognized causes of sudden death among teenagers. ARVC can cause some abnormal heart rhythms that can result to the weakening of the heart's pumping action. In most cases, this medical condition is not fatal and does not significantly affect the quality of life. However, a number of patients usually develop some other complications and would require constant medical attention.
10342	This disorder is an unusual heart ailment that involves primarily right ventricle. It causes the muscle tissue of right ventricle to be changed by fibrous or fatty tissue which affects the capability of the heart to pump blood. It is distinguished by hypokinetic parts relating the free wall of the right ventricle, with fibro-fatty substitute of the right ventricular myocardium, together with related arrhythmias starting in the right ventricle. It is also referred to as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy or ARVC.
10343	Arsenic Poisoning is a type of poisoning which results from ingestion of food and fluid containig the chemical arsenic.
10344	Arterial tortuosity is an unusual hereditary connective tissue disorder distinguished by elongated and widespread tortuosity of the main arteries involving the aorta. The autosomal recessive acquired and location of the gene responsible is in the chromosome 20q13.
10345	Arteriosclerosis is a general term for several disorders causing thickening, loss of elasticity, and hardening of the walls of the arteries with the most common form called atherosclerosis.
10346	Arteriovenous Fistula is an abnormal passageway between an artery and a vein, which can either be present at birth, created surgically intended for hemodialysis treatments for patients with end-stage kidney failures, or acquired either by trauma or erosion of an aneurysm in an artery. As a disease, arteriovenous fistula is referred to as arteriovenous malformation, a congenital disorder of the connections between arteries and veins in the cardiovascular system of the body.
10347	Arteriovenous malformation or commonly known as AVM is an inborn disorder distinguished with a multifaceted, twisted web of arteries and veins. The hereditary spreading guide of AVM (if any) are unidentified, and AVM is not usually considered to be an inborn disorder--unless in the framework of a particular genetic disease. AVM may be evident at birth it may appear as a blemish that resembles a hemangioma. Comparing to other areas of the skin the skin of the AVM is warmer to the touch. The blemish is dark red. Throbbing in the mass can be noticed from the fast moving among arteries and veins.
10348	Arteritis is the inflammation of the walls of an artery. It usually results from a contamination or auto-immune reaction. Kinds a) Temporal arteritis - also called as giant cell arteritis. It is particularly arteritis of the vessels providing the head, eyes and optic nerves, mainly the temporal artery. This is common in old aged individuals. A swollen head artery results to headache. b) Takayasu's arteritis - distresses the aorta and its branches. A thrombo-obliterative procedure of the enormous vessels starting in the aortic arch, it takes place usually in young women. Radial and carotid pulses are usually destroyed. Due to the distressed movements it causes the skin to change. Other effects may be hair loss and deteriorated skin and deteriorate of the skin and its branches by primary muscle atrophy. c) Polyarteritis nodosa - distresses the medium-sized arteries, particularly those of renal, coronary, hepatic and skeletal muscle systems. Arteritis can be partly caused by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans.
10349	Arthritis is a condition that usually involves damage on the joints of the body. For people older than fifty-five years, it is the leading cause of disability. Arthritis is a medicinal term, which mean any kind of joint swelling but the term is usually used to refer to age-related osteoarthritis that is the most usual kind. Though, there are other kinds of arthritis involving rheumatoid arthritis (second-most usual, involving younger adults and juveniles), and different kinds of minor arthritis which are caused by a primary condition: immediate arthritis caused by an infection, psoriatic arthritis from psoriasis, gonococcal arthritis from gonorrhea, and the like. Several probable circumstances with arthritis-like signs involve ankylosing spondylitis and gout.
10350	Still's disease, is a kind of arthritis that occurs in children. Children with Still's disease often experience common arthritic symptoms adults suffer, and about 300,000 children in the United States are affected by the disease.
10351	Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) previously identified as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is the most ordinary type of unrelenting arthritis in children. Occasionally it is called as juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) a term that is not exact as JIA does not include all types of persistent childhood arthritis. Arthritis causes the lining of the joint (synovium) to swell. JIA is a division of arthritis noticeable during childhood, which might be temporary and self-limited or persistent. It varies considerably from arthritis usually noticed in adults (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis), and other kinds of arthritis that can present in infancy which are persistent conditions.
10352	Arthritis, septic (septic arthritis) is an inflammation of a joint that results from a bacterial infection, or, in rare cases, from a viral or fungal infection. Also sometimes called infectious arthritis or bacterial arthritis, this disease is commonly acute but has the potential to become chronic.
10353	Arthritis, thumb (or thumb arthritis) is characterized by inflammation of the joint of the wrist and the base of the thumb (basal or carpometacarpal joint). Thumb arthritis is also alternatively called basal joint arthritis.
10354	Arthrocentesis is a procedure in which a syringe is inserted to collect synovial fluid from an infected joint. This procedure is used to diagnose illnesses such as gout and arthritis. It is also known as joint aspiration.
10355	Arthrogryposis also referred to as Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita, an unusual hereditary disorder that results to multiple joint contractures and is distinguished by weakness of the muscle and fibrosis.

It is said that several African people are liable to an augmented skill to absorb iron. Initially, this was said to be a cause of ungalvanised barrels utilized to keep home-made beer that led to augmented oxidation and augmented levels of iron in the beer. Additional researches show that only those individuals that drink this beer acquires an overload in iron and the same syndrome happened in the people of African descent. Because of this, researchers were led to discover the gene polymorphism in the gene for ferroportin that prompts several individuals of African descent to overload iron.

10453	Barotrauma pertains to physical damage to tissues as a consequence of pressure differences between an air space inside the body and the surrounding liquid or gas. Typically, barotrauma occurs when an individual rapidly moves to and from a higher pressure environment; such as when a scuba diver rapidly ascends or descends underwater.
10454	Barrett's Esophagus is a condition marked by the changes in color and composition of the cells lining the lower esophagus due to repeated stomach acid exposure often due to long-term gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
10455	Barrett's syndrome, also known as "Barrett's esophagus", "CELLO" or simply "Barrett's" is a condition wherein patients experience an abnormal change in the cells of the lower part of the esophagus. Named after Dr. Norman Barrett, a British surgeon from St. Thomas Hospital that described the condition in 1957, Barrett's syndrome is believed to be caused by reflux esophagitis or damage from exposure to chronic acid. Barrett's syndrome occurs in 10% of patients seeking medical attention for heartburn. In addition, Barrett's is considered a premalignant condition, which is associated with a great risk of esophageal cancer.
10456	Barth syndrome also recognized as 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria type II and Cardiomyopathy-neutropenia syndrome it is an unusual hereditary disorder categorized by a lot of signs and symptoms and also includes motor skills being delayed, metabolism distortion, stamina deficiency, chronic fatigue, cardiomyopathy, delayed growth, and compromised immune system. The research or study of Dr. Peter Barth in the Netherlands and discovery in 1983 was the reason why the syndrome was named after him. He designed a pedigree chart where in it shows that the disease is an inborn behavior.
10457	Bartholin cyst pertains to a swelling or bulging of Bartholin's glands, usually as a result of obstruction or infection of the vaginal opening.
10458	Bartholin's abscess is caused by the build-up of pus that will eventually form a lump or swelling in one of the Bartholin's glands. This is located on either side of the vaginal opening.
10459	Bartonella infections previously known as Rochalimaea it is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria. Bartonella species may contaminate healthy people though are considered particularly essential as opportunistic pathogens. Bartonella is spread by insect vectors like fleas, ticks, sand flies and mosquitoes. It is known that eight Bartonella species or subspecies are recognized to infect humans. Bartonella rochalimae was the sixth species discovered in June 2007 that is recognized to infect humans and also the ninth species and subspecies generally recognized to infect humans.
10460	Bartter syndrome, classic form is an unusual hereditary abnormality in the thick ascending limb of the ring of Henle. It is distinguished by decreased potassium levels, low acidity of blood (alkalosis), and regular to decreased blood pressure. 2 types of Barter syndrome: Neonatal Bartter syndrome Classic Bartter syndrome It is closely related to Gitelman syndrome which is milder comparing it to both Bartter syndrome subtypes.
10461	Basal cell cancer is a frequently occurring type of skin cancer. However, it is also the most easy to treat and has the least likelihood of spreading. In general, basal cell cancer is seldom fatal; however, if untreated, it can cause widespread damage to surrounding bones and tissues.
10462	Basal cell carcinoma most usual form of skin cancer and it can be damaging and disfiguring. The danger of growing BCC is elevated for persons with a family history of the illness and with an elevated increasing contact to UV light by means of sunlight or were uncovered to carcinogenic chemicals, particularly arsenic in the past.

10467	Batten disease is an unusual, deadly, autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder which starts in early days of a person. The disease is also referred to as Spielmeyer-Vogt-Sjogren-Batten disease it is the most usual type of a group of disorders referred to as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (or NCLs). History The disease is named after the British pediatrician Frederick Batten who initially explained about the Batten disease in 1903. It is the most usual form of a collection of disorders referred to as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Though Batten disease is commonly observed as the juvenile type of NCL several physicians refer to Batten disease to all types of NCL or ceroid lipofuscinosis.
10468	BDD or body dysmorphic disorder is a condition wherein the affected individual is excessively fixated or preoccupied with real or imagined defects in his/her physical appearance.
10469	Beals Syndrome, also known as Congenital contractural arachnodactyly or CCA, is a heritable disorder involving the connective tissue of the skeleton. It is related to, but distinct from, Marfan Syndrome.
10470	Grooves across the fingernails or transverse lines are called Beau's lines. These nail abnormalities refer to shape, texture, abnormal color or thickness of the toenails or fingernails. With normal nail growth, the lines progress distally and eventually disappear at the free edge.
10471	Becker's muscular dystrophy (BMD), also known as benign pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy, is an X-linked inherited disorder that involves the slowly and progressive weakness of the muscle in the legs and pelvis. It is a type of dystrophinopathy, which includes a range of muscle diseaseswhere there is insufficient dystrophin produced in the muscle cells, resulting in instability in the muscle cell membrane's structure.
10472	Becker's nevus is a skin disorder that predominantly affects males. The nevus mostly first appears as an irregular pigmentation (hyperpigmentation) on the torso or upper arm (though other areas of the body can be affected), and gradually enlarges in an irregular shape, becoming thickened and often developing abnormal hair growth (hypertrichosis). It is also known as Becker's pigmented hairy nevus, Becker nevus, Becker pigmented hairy nevus, Becker melanosis and pigmented hairy epidermal nevus.
10473	Beckwith-Wiedmann syndrome (BWS) is an inherited disorder that affects a person's normal growth development.
10474	Bed-wetting is a developmental phase wherein an infant or child is unable to retain bladder control at nighttime. It is also sometimes called nocturnal enuresis or nighttime incontinence.
10475	Bedbug Bites are little red bumps on the skin caused by bites of a bedbug. A bedbug is a small, flat, reddish bug that can be found in every home.
10476	also known as pressure sores, decubitus ulcers or pressure ulcers areas of damaged skin and tissue develops when sustained pressure cuts off circulation causes the tissue of the vulnerable parts of the body to die. Prone areas include the skin on the hips, buttocks, and heels.
10477	Bee And Wasp Stings are insect stings brought about by bites of bees and wasps. Bees are fuzzy insects that feed on flowers while wasps are non-fuzzy insects closely related to bees but can also feed on animal food and other insects. The two insects may l
10478	Behτet's (pronounced 'BAY-sets') disease is a disease that causes symptoms in various parts of the body. It produces a group of symptoms that affect different body systems, including gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and the central nervous system. These symptoms include mouth or genital ulcers, skin lesions, and inflammation of the uvea which is an area around the pupil of the eye. Common symptoms include sores found in the mouth and on the genitals. More serious symptoms can include inflammation (combined with swelling, heat, redness, and pain) in the eyes and other parts of the body.
10479	Behr's Syndrome is a rare inherited neurological condition named after Carl Behr, who first described it in 1909 as a syndrome of variable pyramidal tract signs. It is characterized by spastic paraplegia and sometimes optic atrophy. It is a hereditary familial syndrome that falls under ocular and neurologic disorders affecting both men and women. Behr's Syndrome starts in infancy with disturbed vision, disturbed coordination with ataxia, mental deficiency, and urinary sphincter weakness. Other characteristics include optic atrophy prevalent in males, scotoma, bilateral retrobulbar neuritis, nystagmus, progressive temporal nerve atrophy, increased tendon reflexes, Babinski sign, and incoordination. Its inheritance is autosomal recessive, meaning it is not linked to sex chromosomes, although heterozygotes may still manifest much attenuated symptoms.
10480	Bejel, which was previously called endemic syphilis, is a nonsexually transmitted infection caused by treponemal spirochetes closely related to Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes the sexually transmitted disease syphilis. Bejel, yaws, and pinta are diseases closely related to syphilis. They mainly occur in the tropics and subtropics. Unlike syphilis, they are transmitted through skin contact, mostly between children living in poor hygienic conditions. Like syphilis, these diseases start with skin sores and have a latent period that is followed by more a destructive disease. Bejel occurs mainly in the warm arid countries like the eastern Mediterranean region and West Africa. Yaws occurs in equatorial countries. Pinta is most common among the Indians of Mexico, Central America, and South America. Although the bacteria that causes bejel, Treponema pallidum endemicum, is morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from Treponema pallidum pallidum, transmission of bejel is not venereal in nature, generally resulting from mouth-to-mouth contact, skin-to-skin contact, or sharing of domestic utensils, and the courses of the two diseases are vary somewhat.
10481	Bell's Palsy is a paralysis of the facial nerve which results to an inability to control facial muscles in the affected side. There are several conditions that can cause facial paralysis: brain tumor, stroke, and Lyme disease. However, if no specific cause can be traced to the paralysis, the condition is called Bell's Palsy. It is named after the Scottish anatomist Charles Bell, who first described it. Bell's palsy is the most common acute mononeuropathy, or diseases involving only one nerve, and is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis. Bell's Palsy is defined as an idiopathic unilateral facial nerve paralysis, and is usually self-limiting. Its trademark is the rapid onset of partial or complete palsy, usually in a single day.
10482	Benign astrocytoma (or astrocytoma Grade I, astrocytoma Grade II, intracranial neoplasm, intracranial tumor) is categorized into two types: Diffuse (Adults, cerebral hermisphere and brainstem) and circumscribed (Children, characteristic location/morphology). They are benign tumors that occur in the brain or spinal cord. Symptoms and severity of the astrocytoma depends on its location and size.
10483	Benign congenital hypotonia is a condition of abnormally low muscle tone, which is the amount of tension or resistance to movement in a muscle, and it often involves reduced muscle strength. It is not a specific medical disorder, but a potential manifestation of many different diseases and disorders that affect the motor nerve control of the brain or muscle strength. Recognizing benign congenital hypotonia, even in early infancy, is relatively straightforward, but diagnosing the cause underlying it can be difficult and often unsuccessful. The long-term effects of hypotonia on a child's growth and development, and later on in life, depend primarily on how severe the muscle weakness is and the nature of the cause. Other names of this condition are Hypotonia , Congenital Hypotonia, Congenital Muscle Hypotonia , Congenital Muscle Weakness, and Amyotonia Congenita.
10484	Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions and spasms and twitching of the eyelid muscles. It is a form of dystonia, a movement disorder where muscle contractions cause sustained eyelid closure, twitching or repetitive movements. BEB starts gradually with increased frequency of eye blinking often associated with irritation of the eye.
10485	Benign essential tremor (ET) is a movement disorder affecting the neurological system. It is characterized by involuntary fine rhythmic tremor of a body part or different parts, mostly the hands and arms (upper limbs). In many individuals affected by this, upper limb tremor may occur as an isolated finding. In others, however, tremors may gradually involve other regions of the anatomy, such as the head, voice, tongue, or palate (roof of the mouth), leading to dysarthria, or difficulty articulating speech. Less common are tremors that affect muscles of the torso or legs. It is also known as Presenile Tremor Syndrome, familial essential tremor, or hereditary benign tremor.
10486	Benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) is a disorder affecting the neurological system and characterized by fasciculation (or twitching) of various voluntary muscles in the body. The twitching can occur in any voluntary muscle group but is most commonly found in the eyelids, arms, legs, and feet. Even the tongue may be affected by BFS. The twitching may be occasional or may go on almost continuously. Any intentional movement of the affected muscle causes the fasciculation to cease immediately, but may return once the muscle is at rest again.
10487	Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH), also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a neurological condition that consists of exaggerated brain pressure without the presence of tumors or edemas in the brain.
10488	Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), also known as benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV), is a condition caused by problems in the inner ear.
10488	Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a kind of dizziness that affects one's sense of balance. It is caused by the accumulation of the particles of the inner ear that tug on to hairlike sensors that help coordinate the person in maintaining steady balance. It can be treated by clearing out the particles and position them back in their places via surgery.
10489	Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia is the non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland; the male organ that produces semen. Enlargement of the prostate can put pressure to the urethra causing difficulty in urination.
10490	Benign prostatic hyperplasia is also called nodular hyperplasia or benign enlargement of the prostate, benign prostatic hypertrophy. This refers to the condition wherein the prostate, usually of middle-aged men to elderly men, increase in size. The condition is one of a hyperplasia not hypertrophy as previously believed. The prostatic stromal and epithelial cells becomes hyperplastic which then results to the formation of fairly discrete and large nodules of the prostate specifically in the periurethral region. The enlarge nodules then compress the urethral canal and cause obstruction of the urethra either partially or completely, which interferes urination.
10491	Berdon's Syndrome, also known as Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIH), is a disorder of newborn babies, most prevalent in females, characterized by constipation and urinary retention, microcolon, giant bladder (or megacystis), hydronephrosis, intestinal hypoperistalis, and dilated small bowel. It results from a dysfunction of the smooth muscle in the abdomen and digestive system. This disorder prevents the intestines, stomach, kidneys, and bladder from functioning correctly. The pathological findings consist of a large quantity of ganglion cells in both dilated and narrow areas of the intestine. It is a familial disturbance of unknown origin. Experts disagree whether inheritance is autosomal dominant or recessive. In 1976, Berdon and company first described the condition in five female infants, two of whom were sisters. All had marked bladder dilatation and some had hydronephrosis and the external appearance of a prune belly. The infants also had microcolon and sverely dilated small intestines.
10492	Bereavement is a psychological state in which a person succumbs to depression due to a loss of a loved one. This is typical among people who have lost their loved ones due to a traumatic or sudden event.
10493	Berger's Disease (also known as primary IgA nephropathy, glomerulonephritis with IgA and IgG deposits and IgA mesangial nephropathy), has a wide pattern of distribution and is thought to be the most common form of primary glomerular disease throughout the world. Although highly prevalent, geographic variations occur, which could be due to genetic as well as enviromental influences on the patient. This is a kind of glomerulonephritis resulting from the deposition of circulating IgA antibody in the kidney tissues. Inflammation of the glomerulus (glomerulonephritis) is the result of this and may present as acute glomerulonephritis, chronic glomerulonephritis or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. This renal disorder more commonly affects males in the 16-40 age range.
10494	Beriberi is an ailment affecting the nervous system. It is caused by a deficiency in thiamine (vitamin B1). The etymology of the word is from a Sinhalese phrase meaning literally, "I cannot, I cannot", the word being repeated for emphasis.
10495	Berlin breakage syndrome, also known as Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) and Seemanova syndrome, is a rare syndrome that is characterized by chromosomal instability, maybe as a result of a defect in the Double Holliday junction DNA repair mechanism. It is a very rare syndrome characterized mainly by a small head, lowered immunity and heightened risk of cancer. The features of this condition are basically indistinguishable from the Nigmegen Breakage syndrome. The name comes from the Dutch city Nijmegen where the condition was first discovered. Most people with NBS originate from West Slavic regions. The largest number of them is Polish.
10496	Bernard-Soulier disease is condition usually present in newborn infants, wherein the blood platelets are not able to stick to the ruptured walls of the blood vessel. This may cause problems in blood clotting and becomes a result of profuse abnormal bleeding.
10497	Berylliosis, also known as chronic beryllium disorder (CBD), is an occupational lung disease. It is a chronic allergic-type lung response and chronic lung disease that results from exposure to beryllium and its compounds. Berylliosis is incurable but its symptoms can be treated.
10498	Besnier-Boeck-Schaumann disease, also known as sarcoidosis, is a disease which can affect different organs inside the body. It causes the development of microscopic granulomas on the organs. These are masses resembling little tumors or look like grains of sugar or sand. They are made up of groups of cells from the immune system. These tiny granulomas can increase in size and number and clump together, making many large and small groups of lumps. If numerous granulomas form in an organ, they can affect how the organ functions. This can cause symptoms of Besnier-Boeck-Schaumann disease.
10499	Beta thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body.
10500	Bhaskar Jagannathan syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the clustering of features like aminoaciduria, arachnodactyly, cerebellar ataxia, congenital cataracts, and delayed developmental milestones. It is a very rare syndrome characterized primarily by long, thin fingers, cataracts that form during infancy, amino acids in the urine, incoordination and delayed development. When the affected person was first reported, the author raised the question if it could be a new cerebro-oculo-renal syndrome.
10501	A bicuspid aortic valve is a heart valve possessing two cusps that are situated between the left ventrical and the aorta. A congenitally bicuspid aortic valve has 2 working leaflets. Most people have 2 complete commissures. An approximated half of cases have a low raphe. Excluded are stenotic or partially fused valves caused by inflammatory processes, such as rheumatic fever.
10502	Bilateral renal agenesis is uncommon and is a serious condition, related to Potter's Syndrome. Bilateral renal agenesis is the lack of both kidneys at birth. It is a genetic disorder characterized by a failure of the kidneys to develop as a fetus inside the womb. This absence of kidneys results to a deficiency of amniotic fluid (or oligohydramnios) in a pregnant woman. Normally, the amniotic fluid serves as a cushion for the developing fetus. When there is not enough amount of this fluid, compression of the fetus may occur resulting in further malformations of the baby. It is the consequence of failure of differentiation of the metanephric blastema during the 25-28th day of development and both ureters and kidneys and renal arteries are missing. This disorder is more commonly found in infants born of a parent who has a kidney malformation, particularly the absence of one kidney (or unilateral renal agenesis). Studies have proven that unilateral renal agenesis and bilateral renal agenesis are genetically related to eachother. 1 out of 3 infants with this congenital defect are not born alive. Most infants that are born alive do not live beyond the coarse of four hours.
10503	Bile duct cancer is a relatively rare carcinoma affecting the biliary tract. This type of cancer, also called cholangiocarcinomas, can also occur in several areas in and around the liver.
10504	Bile reflux is a condition characterized by bile flowing upward from the small intestine into the stomach and esophagus. Bile, a digestive fluid produced by the liver, can inflame and then damage the esophageal lining and stomach.
10505	Biliary atresia is a rare condition found in newborn infants in which the common bile duct between the liver and the small intestine is blocked or missing. If it goes unrecognized, the condition leads to liver failure but not to kernicterus. This is due to the liver still able to conjugate bilirubin, and conjugated bilirubin is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier. The only effective treatments for biliary atresia are certain surgeries, or liver transplantation.
10506	Primary biliary cirrhosis is a disease in which the bile ducts in the liver are slowly and steadily destroyed. The body has an intricate system of ducts designed specifically to transport bile, which is a fluid produced in the liver. Bile is needed for the proper digestion of fats and helps rid the body of worn-out red blood cells, cholesterol and potentially toxic metals. In primary biliary cirrhosis, the destruction of bile ducts can cause dangerous substances to build up in the liver and sometimes lead to irreversible scarring of liver tissue (or cirrhosis). Many experts consider primary biliary cirrhosis an autoimmune disease in which the body turns against its own cells, although it's possible that genetic and environmental factors also play a part. Primary biliary cirrhosis develops somewhat slowly. Medication can slow the progression of the disease, especially if treatment starts early.
10507	Binge-eating disorder is characterized by a compulsion to frequently overeat. In people with binge-eating disorder, the gorging becomes a regular ritual, shrouded in shame, secrecy, and feelings of self-loathing. Bing-eating is also alternatively known as compulsive overeating.
10508	Binswanger's Disease, also known as subcortical dementia, is a rare form of dementia characterized by cerebrovascular lesions in the deep white-matter of the brain, mood changes, and loss of memory and cognition. Patients often show signs of abnormal blood pressure, blood abnormalities, stroke, disease of the large blood vessels in the neck, and disease of the heart valves. Other prominent features of the disease include urinary incontinence, clumsiness, difficulty walking, speech difficulty, slowness of conduct, and lack of facial expression. These symptoms, which tend to start after the age of 60, are not present in all patients and may sometimes appear only as a passing phase.
10509	Biotin Deficiency otherwise known as the Vitamin H deficiency is a nutritional disorder where a person is deficient in taking biotin or the water-soluble B vitamin.
10510	Biotinidase Deficiency (BIOT) is the result of the lack of an enzyme called biotinidase. Without treatment, this disorder can cause seizures, developmental delay, eczema, and hearing loss.
10511	Bipolar disorder is not just a single disorder, but a group of mood disorders defined by the presence of one or more episodes of abnormally elevated mood, clinically referred to as mania. People who experience manic episodes also commonly experience depressive episodes or symptoms, or combined episodes which present with features of both mania and depression. These episodes are normally separated by periods of normal mood, but in some patients, depression and mania may rapidly alternate with eachother, known as rapid cycling. The disorder has been subdivided into bipolar I, bipolar II and cyclothymia and is based on the type and severity of mood episodes experienced.
10512	Bird flu is a disease commonly affecting wild and domestic birds that, when transmitted to humans, can be potentially fatal.
10513	Areas of discolored skin that can be raised or flat usually present at birth or shortly after birth. Few types of birthmarks fade as the child grow while most types are permanent. Most birthmarks are harmless and may fade in time but there are also some that are associated with certain health conditions.
10514	Black Death, also known as the bubonic plague, was a pandemic disease that nearly wiped out Britain's population during the 14th century. It was thought to be caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, but recent studies attribute the plague to other diseases.
10515	Black Eye or the Periorbital Hematoma is the medical condition whereby there is a bruising around the eye because of an injury to the face and not directly to the eye.
10516	Black Lung or black lung disease is a common name for coal worker's pneumoconiosis, a lung disease of long-time workers in the coal industry. Cause is linked to accumulated inhalation of small amounts of coal dust. It has been termed black lung because accumulated inhalation of coal dust made the lung turned black in color instead of the regular pink color.
10517	Blackheads pertain to common skin breakouts characterized by small darkish spots on the skin, usually as a result of obstruction in the opening of the pores.
10518	Bladder calculi are small masses of minerals that form in the bladder, usually as a result of concentrated urine sitting in the bladder for extended periods. Bladder calculi are also known as bladder stones.
10519	Bladder Cancer is a type of cancer occurring in the bladder, which is the organ in the pelvic region responsible for storing urine. Bladder cancer usually starts in the cells lining the inside of the bladder.
10520	Bladder control, loss of (loss of bladder control) is defined by an inability to control urine flow or bladder function. It is also known as urinary incontinence.
10521	Bladder infection pertains to a bacterial infection affecting part or parts of the urinary tract. It is also alternatively known as urinary tract infection or UTI.
10522	Bladder inflammation is a condition characterized by inflammation of the bladder which causes chronic pain in the pelvic area.
10523	Bladder neoplasm (or bladder cancer) is a disease in which abnormal cells multiply and grow in number without control in the bladder. The bladder is a hollow, muscular organ that stores urine and is located in the pelvis. The most common type of bladder cancer starts in cells lining the inside of the bladder and is called urothelial cell or transitional cell carcinoma (UCC or TCC).
10524	Bladder Papilloma is a medical condition where there is a benign tumor that grows in the person's bladder which stores urine produced by the kidneys.
10525	Bladder stones pertain to small mineral masses that develop in the bladder, usually as a consequence of concentrated urine stagnating in the bladder. Alternative names for bladder stones are bladder calculi and urinary tract stones.
10526	Bladder, prolapse (or, more appropriately, prolapsed bladder) is a condition affecting females wherein the wall separating the bladder from the vagina weakens and stretches, allowing the bladder to bulge into the vagina. This condition is also referred to as a cystocele.
10527	Blastocystis hominis infection is an infection caused by a microscopic parasite known as B. hominis, which is commonly found in human stools.
10528	A blastoma is a type of cancer that is brough about by malignancies in precursor cells, often called blasts. It is a tumor thought to result from embryonic tissue. The term "blastoma" is generally used as part of the name for a tumor as, for examples, in glioblastoma and medulloblastoma (types of brain tumors), hepatoblastoma (a liver tumor), nephroblastoma ( Wilms tumor of the kidney), neuroblastoma (a childhood tumor of neural origin), osteoblastoma (a bone tumor) and retinoblastoma (a tumor of the retina). A blastoma is a neoplasm composed of immature and undifferentiated cells derived from the blastema of an organ or tissue.
10529	Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by the Blastomyces dermatitidis organism. Blastomycosis causes clinical symptoms that have similarites to histoplasmosis. The organism causing blastomycosis is endemic to portions of North America.
10530	Bleeding in the digestive tract is considered as a symptom for other diseases rather than disease itself. Common causes of bleeding are related to other conditions such as ulcer. The source of the bleeding may come from the gastrointestinal tract which includes esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine or colon, rectum and anus.
10531	Bleeding varices are a result of dilated blood vessels usually located in the stomach or esophagus. This bleeding is characterized by the increased pressure in the portal vein within the gastro-esophageal tract. When not immediately diagnosed, the condition may lead to serious complications such as liver failure.
10532	Blepharitis is the inflammation of the one's eyelids. It is characterized by inflammation of the margins of the eyelid. Blepharitis generally causes redness of the eyes and itching and irritation of the eyelids in both eyes. Its appearance is often confused with conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and due to its recurring nature it is the most common cause of "recurrent conjunctivitis" in aging people. It is also often treated as 'dry eye' by patients due to the gritty and sandy sensation it may give the eyes - although lubricating drops do little to improve the condition. The two types of blepharitis are anterior blepharitis and posterior blepharitis. In the former, the blepharitis affects the front of the eyelids near the eyelashes. The causes are seborrheic dermatitis (which similar to dandruff) and occasional infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus. The latter affects the back of the eyelids, the part that has contact with the eyes. This is caused by the oil glands that are situated in this region. It is the most common type of blepharitis.
10533	Blepharophimosis is a condition where the individual has bilateral ptosis with reduced lid size. The the patient's nasal bridge is flat and there is hypoplastic orbital rim. Both the vertical and horizontal palpebral fissures (or eyelid opening) are reduced in length. Vignes probably first described this entity as a dysplasia of the eyelids. Aside from small palpebral fissures, features include epicanthus inversus (folds curving in the mediolateral direction, inferior to the inner canthus), low nasal bridge, and ptosis of the eyelids. Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome, either accompanied with premature ovarian failure (BPES type I) or without (BPES type II), is caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene.
10534	A blepharospasm is any abnormal tic or twitch of the eyelid. It generally refers to Benign Essential Blepharospasm (BEP), a focal dystonia, in which a neurological movement disorder affects involuntary and sustained muscle contractions of the muscles around the eyes. Benign means that the condition is not life threatening and essential indicates that the cause of the condition is unknown. Fatigue, stress, or an irritant are possible contributing factors of the condition. Symptoms may sometimes last for a few days then disappear without treatment, but in most of the cases the twitching is chronic and persistent, causing lifelong challenges. The symptoms are often acute enough to result in functional blindness. The person's eyelids feel like they are clamping shut and will not open without much effort. Patients have normal eyes, but for periods of time are basically blind due to their inability to open their eyelids.
10535	Blind loop syndrome pertains to a condition wherein part of the small intestine is cut off or bypassed from the normal flow of food and digestive fluids. It is also alternatively known as stagnant loop syndrome or stasis syndrome.
10536	Blindness is the condition of lacking vision which may be caused by physiological and neurological factors. The clinical term "no light perception" often refers to total blindness. Severe visual impairment with residual vision is also interpretative to blindness. Individuals described to be having only "light perception" are those who have loss sight and can only differentiate light from dark - meaning they only have the capacity to pinpoint the direction where the light is coming from.
10537	Blood clotting is a process where the blood coagulates in order to restore blood vessels during lacerations or whatever event that caused damage. This is an important feature since through blood clotting, open wounds begin to heal by themselves and blood vessels are repaired. The ability to blood clot is due to the sufficient platelet count in the blood. Lack of platelets will result to coronary diseases and clogged arteries which can be very fatal.

It is generally diagnosed in those who are extremely critical of their self-image, despite the fact that there may be no noticeable disfigurement or defect on their physique. It is characterized by an excessive preoccupation with a real or imagined defect in one's physical appearance. People with this disorder have a distorted or exaggerated view of their physical appearance and are obsessed with actual external characteristics or perceived flaws, such as certain facial features or imperfections of their skin. They often think of themselves as disfigured or ugly. People with body dysmorphic disorder often have difficulties controlling negative thoughts concerning their appearance, even when others reassure them that they look fine and that the small or perceived flaws aren't excessive or obvious.
10550	Body lice, or rickets, are parasitic insects that thrive in the human body and eventually cause typhus. This was once a dreaded disease during World War I.
10551	Body odor and sweating pertain to excessive perspiration that produces a foul-smelling smell emanating from the body.
10552	Boil (or furuncle) is a skin disease brought about by the inflammation of hair follicles, resulting in the localized accumulation of pus and dead tissue. Individual boils can group together and form an interconnected network of boils called carbuncles. In severe cases, boils may develop to form in what is known as abscesses.
10553	Painful, pus-filled bumps that form under your skin when bacteria infect and inflame one or more of your follicles are called boils and carbuncles. They usually start as red, tender lumps that quickly fill with pus, growing larder and more painful until they rupture and drain, which mostly take about two weeks to heal although some boils disappear in a few days after they occur. They may appear anywhere on your skin, but appear mainly on your neck, face, armpits, thighs or buttocks where these hair-bearing areas are most likely to sweat or experience friction.

10557	Bone neoplasm, or bone cancer, is when new abnormal bone tissue grows due to excessive cellular division and proliferation. The bone tissue develops more rapidly than normal and continues to grow even after the stimuli that initiated it stops. This includes tumors or cancer located in bone tissue or specific bones.
10558	Bone spurs pertain to bony protrusions or projections around the edges of the bones. Also called osteophytes, bone spurs are not necessarily painful on their own but may rub against surrounding nerves and bones, thus causing pain.
10559	Borderline Personality Disorder is a devastating mental condition characterized by instability about personal perception in combination to difficulty in maintaining stable relationship usually manifested by unpredictable moods, extreme "black and white" thinking, fear of abandonment, and impulsive often self-injurious behavior.

10563	Borreliosis, also known as Lyme disease, is an emerging infectious disease caused by bacteria from the genus Borrelia. The vector of infection is usually the bite of an infected black-legged or deer tick, but other carriers (including other ticks in the genus Ixodes) have been implicated. Borrelia burgdorferi is the leading cause of Lyme disease in the U.S. and Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are found in Europe. The disease presentation varies greatly, and may include a rash and flu-like symptoms in its initial stage, then musculoskeletal, neurologic, arthritic, psychiatric and cardiac manifestations. In a most of the cases, symptoms can be eliminated with antibiotics, especially if treatment begins early in the course of illness. Late or inadequate treatment often results to "late stage" Lyme disease that is disabling and difficult to treat. Controversy over diagnosis, testing and treatment has resulted to two different standards of care.
10564	Bothriocephalosis (also known as Diphyllobothriasis) is an infection with an intestinal parasite. The parasite is a fish tapeworm known as Diphyllobothrium latum. Human infection is caused by eating undercooked fish contaminated with the bacteria. Adult tapeworms may infect humans, felines, canids, pinnipeds, bears, and mustelids, though the accuracy of the records for some of the nonhuman species is disputed. Immature eggs are passed in the feces of the mammal host (the definitive host, where the worms reproduce).
10565	Botulism (from the Latin word, botulus, meaning "sausage") is a rare, but serious paralytic illness caused by a toxin, botulin, that is produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. Botulinic toxin is one of the most powerful known toxins: about one microgram is deadly to humans. It acts by blocking nerve function and leads to respiratory and musculoskeletal paralysis to the individual.
10566	Bourneville's disease (also known as Tuberous sclerosis) is characterized by facial lesions with tuberous sclerosis, first reported as adenoma sebaceum, but now recognised as angiofibromas. It produces tuberous sclerosis occurring in association with adenoma sebaceum. It is syndrome of epilepsy, severe mental retardation associated with adenoma sebaceum (overgrowth of the sebaceous glands) of the face, hamartomatous tumours of the heart and kidney, and cerebral cortical tubers (hence the name "tuberous sclerosis"). It is heredofamilial and usually shows itself early in life. Females are more often affected by this disease than males. Incomplete forms of the syndrome can manifest. Bourneville's disease is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with variable expressivity.

10573	Brachydactyly (BD) refers to shortening of the fingers or toes that results from the underdevelopment of the bones in the hands or feet. Brachydactyly is a medical term is literally meaning "shortness of the fingers and toes". The shortness is relative to the length of the individual's other long bones and other parts of the body. Brachydactyly is an inherited trait, usually dominat.. It most frequently occurs as an isolated dysmelia, but can also occur with other anomalies as part of many congenital syndromes. Brachydactyly is a general term that refers to disproportionately shortened fingers and toes. It can arise as an isolated finding, or be associated with a pattern of medical findings, called a syndrome. To date, many different forms of brachydactyly have been categorized. As a group, they always include extremely shortened tubular bones in the hands and feet. Some forms also lead to short stature, while others do not. The majority of types of isolated brachydactyly are passed on as autosomal dominant conditions. Radiographic studies (X-rays) can aid physicians differentiate between the different types of brachydactyly.

10576	In medicine (neurology), bradykinesia means "slow movement". Its etymology is brady = slow, kinesia = movement. It is a feature of several of diseases, most notably Parkinson's disease and other disorders of the basal ganglia. Rather than being a slowness in initiation (related to hypokinesia) bradykinesia describes a slowness in the execution of movement.
10577	A brain aneurysm is characterized by the bulge in a brain's artery. The most One of the most common types of brain aneurysm resembles a round berry that is attached to the artery. Such aneurisms can usually go undetected since it has no symptoms for years and as long as it does not rupture, it poses no real threats.
10577	Brain aneurysm is characterized by a bulge forming in an artery of the brain, which may be tiny or large enough to put pressure on surrounding brain tissue.
10578	Brain attack is a type of stroke that occurs from a drastic shortage of blood supply in the brain. Brain cells will commonly die in a matter of minutes. A brain attack is more commonly referred to as a stroke.
10579	Brain bleed is another name used to describe cerebral hemorrhage. Also known as stroke, brain bleed brings about serious damages such as paralysis. The effects of brain bleed may no longer be reversed or may require intensive therapy. It can also cause sudden death.

10586	A branchial cyst is an oval cystic mass that grows between the pharynx and the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the neck. This kind of cyst is asymptomatic and is caused by the accumulation of embryonic remnants after one's development. It can also result from the failure of the second branchial cleft to obliterate. Treatment for the cyst is done by surgery.
10587	Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that features ear tags just below the outer ear, branchiial fistulas, hearing loss and kidney problems.
10588	Branchiootorenal (BOR) syndrome is marked by malformations of the outer, middle, and inner ear associated with conductive, sensorineural, or mixed hearing impairment; branchial fistulae and cysts; and renal malformations, ranging from mild renal hypoplasia to bilateral renal agenesis. The presence, severity, and type of branchial arch, otologic, audiologic, and renal abnormality may be different from right side to left side in an affected individual and also among individuals in the same family. Some individuals develop to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) later in life. The name branciootorenal syndrome describes the body systems most frequently affected by this genetic disorder. The term "branchio" refers to the abnormalities of the neck found in people affected with this syndrome. Cysts (lump or swelling that can be filled with fluid) and fistulas (abnormal passage from the throat to the skin) in the neck appear frequently. The term "oto" refers to the ear disorders that are associated with the syndrome. For example, the outer ear can be abnormal in appearance. Hearing loss is also commonly associated to the syndrome. Finally, the term "renal" stands for the kidney problems commonly found in patients with this condition.
10589	Brazilian pemphigus foliaceus is a kind of cutaneous disease that is characterized by the presence of intraepidermal blisters and lesions. The disease is pandemic in Brazil. It can be treated by drugs such as penicillamine and rifampin, and can be diagnosed by means of skin biopsy.

10593	Breast engorgement is a condition in which the mammary glands contain too much milk that cannot be released.
10594	Breast infection is an infection affecting the breast tissue of nursing mothers characterized by swelling, redness, and pain in the breast. It is also alternatively known as mastitis.
10595	Breast pain is a common complaint of discomfort among women, affecting approximately seventy percent of females at some point in their lives. Breast pain, also known as mastalgia, is more common in the younger age bracket, particularly among pre-menopausal women, although it may afflict older females as well.
10596	Bright's disease (also known as nephritis) is a historical classification of kidney diseases that is described in modern medicine as acute or chronic nephritis. The term is no longer in use, as diseases are now classified according to their more fully understood etiologies. It is typically characterized by the presence of serum albumin (blood plasma) in the urine, and frequently accompanied by edema (tissue particulate). Many people believe that too much protein consumption can lead to Bright's disease, but this is a spurious statement and is nothing but a myth.
10597	Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI, or sometimes known as Brittle Bone Disease) is a genetic bone disorder. People with this disease are born without the proper protein (collagen), or the ability to make it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I collagen. People with OI either have lesser collagen than normal or the quality is poorer than normal. As collagen is an important protein in bone structure, this impairment can result to those with the condition to have weak or fragile bones. As a genetic disorder, brittle bone disease is an autosomal dominant defect. Most people with OI inherit it from a parent but it can also be an individual (as in de novo or "sporadic") mutation.
10598	Broken ankle is a common situation characterized by a break in one or more bones that make up the ankle joint; including the tibia, fibula, and talus.
10599	A broken arm is a common type of injury that involves a range of fractures in the upper limbs.

10601	A broken hand is a fracture in the bones of the hand, usually occurring along with a broken wrist.
10602	A broken hip pertains to fractures in the hip bones usually occurring in older adults aged 65 and above. A broken hip is a potentially serious injury with life-threatening complications.
10603	A broken leg is defined as a fracture or a crack in one of the leg bones. It is also alternatively known as a leg fracture.
10604	A broken nose is characterized by a break, fracture, or crack in one or more bones found in the nose. The most commonly broken bone is the bone over the nose bridge.
10605	Broken ribs pertain to a common injury wherein the bones in the rib cage breaks, fractures, or cracks.
10606	Bronchial asthma is a pulmonary inflammation wherein the air passages become narrow, causing incessant coughing, shortness of breath and wheezing. Severe asthma attacks can be fatal.
10607	Bronchiectasis is a disease that results to localized, irreversible dilatation of part of the bronchial tree. Involved bronchi are dilated, inflamed, and easily collapsible, leading to airflow obstruction and impaired clearance of secretions. Bronchiectasis is associated with a wide range of disorders, but it usually arises from necrotizing bacterial infections, such as infections caused by the Staphylococcus or Klebsiella species or Bordetella pertussis.
10608	Bronchiolitis is inflammation of the small airways of the lungs, usually occurring in young children between three to six months of age.
10609	Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (or BOOP) is the inflammation of the bronchioles and surrounding tissue in the lungs. BOOP is often the result of a pre-existing chronic inflammatory disease like rheumatoid arthritis. BOOP can also be a side effect of certain medicinal drugs, such as amiodarone. In cases where no cause is detected, the disease is called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The clinical characteristics and radiological imaging resemble infectious pneumonia. However, diagnosis is suspected after there is no response to multiple antibiotics, and blood and sputum cultures are found to be negative for organisms.
10610	Bronchitis is a condition that occurs when the inner walls lining the main airways of the lungs become inflamed; usually happening after a previous respiration infection like colds.
10611	Chronic bronchitis is the inflammation, or irritation, of the airways in the lungs. Airways are the tubes in the lungs where air passes through. They are also known as bronchial tubes. When the airways are irritated, thick mucus forms inside of them. The mucus plugs up the airways and makes it hard for the person to get air into your lungs. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis include a cough that produces mucus (sometimes called sputum), breathing difficulties, and a feeling of tightness in the chest.
10612	Bronchopulmonary dysplasia involves the abnormal development of lung tissue. It is marked by inflammation and scarring in the lungs. It occurs most often in premature babies, who are born with underdeveloped lungs. "Broncho" is the name of the airways (the bronchial tubes) through which the oxygen we breathe travels into the lungs. "Pulmonary" refers to the lungs' tiny air sacs (alveoli), where carbon dioxide and oxygen are exchanged. "Dysplasia" means abnormal changes in the organization or structure of a group of cells. The cell changes in BPD occur in the smaller airways and lung alveoli, making breathing difficult and causing problems with lung function.
10613	Bronze diabetes, or hemachromatosis, is a kind of diabetes caused by an overload of iron deposits in the body tissues. Without treatment, iron overload may cause complications and eventually lead to organ failure.
10614	Brown Syndrome is a rare eye disorder marked by defects in eye movements. This disorder may be present at birth (congenital) or may occur as the due to another underlying disorder (acquired). Muscles control eye movements and activities. Some of these muscles turn the eyeball up and down, move the eyeball from side to side, or let the eyeball to rotate slightly in its socket. The superior oblique tendon sheath of the superior oblique is the muscle that surrounds the eyeball. The symptoms of Brown Syndrome are due to abnormalities of this tendon sheath including shortening, thickening, or inflammation. This leads to the inability to move the affected eye upward.
10615	Brucellosis, also known as undulant fever, undulating fever, or Malta fever, is a zoonosis (infectious disease transmitted from animals to humans) caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella. It is generally a disease of domestic animals (goats, pigs, cattle, dogs, etc) and humans and has a worldwide distribution, mostly now in developing countries.
10616	The Brugada syndrome is a genetic disease that is marked by abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. It is also known as Sudden Unexpected Death Syndrome (SUDS), and is the most commonly found cause of sudden death in young men without known underlying cardiac disease in Thailand and Laos. Although the ECG findings of Brugada syndrome were first reported among survivors of cardiac arrest in 1989, it was only in 1992 that the Brugada brothers recognised it as a distinct clinical entity, causing sudden death by resulting to ventricular fibrillation (a lethal arrhythmia) in the heart.
10617	Bruton agammaglobulinemia was the first immunodeficiency disease to be described. Colonel Ogden Bruton noted in 1952 the absence of immunoglobulins in a young male with a history of pneumonias and other bacterial sinopulmonary infections. Bruton was also the first physician to furnish specific immunotherapy for this X-linked disorder by administering intramuscular injections of immunoglobulin G (IgG). The patient improved but died of chronic pulmonary disease in his fourth decade of life. This disorder is now formally known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), and the gene defect has been mapped to the gene that codes for Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) at band Xq21.3. The BTK gene is big and consists of 19 exons that encode the 659 amino acids that form the Btk cytosolic tyrosine kinase. Mutations can happen in any area of the gene. Btk is needed for the proliferation and differentiation of B lymphocytes. In the absence of working Btk, mature B cells that express surface immunoglobulin and the marker CD19 are few to absent. The lack of CD19 is readily detected with fluorocytometric assays, and this finding usually easily confirms the diagnosis of XLA in a male. As Bruton originally described, XLA shows itself as pneumonias and other bacterial sinopulmonary infections in 80% of cases. Such infections that start in male infants as maternal IgG antibodies, acquired transplacentally, are lost. Thus, XLA is most often diagnosed when unusually severe or recurrent sinopulmonary infections occur in a male infant younger than 1 year.
10618	Bruxism is the medical term used in referring to gnashing, grinding or clenching of teeth; usually affecting children and adults alike. Individuals with bruxism clench teeth at daytime usually when anxious or stressed. Long-term bruxism leads to unpleasant conditions such as jaw problems, damaged teeth, and headache.
10619	The bubonic plague, also known as bubonic fever, is the best-known variant of the deadly infectious disease caused by the enterobacteria Yersinia pestis (Pasteurella pestis). The epidemiological use of the term "plague" is currently applied to bacterial infections that cause buboes, although historically the medical use this term has been applied to pandemic infections in general.
10620	In medicine (gastroenterology and hepatology), Budd-Chiari syndrome is the clinical picture resulted from occlusion of the hepatic vein or inferior vena cava. It presents with the classical triad of abdominal pain, ascites and hepatomegaly. Some examples of occlusion include thrombosis of hepatic veins and membranous webs in the inferior vena cava. The syndrome can be acute, fulminant, chronic, or asymptomatic. It takes place in 1 out of 100,000 individuals and is more common in females. Some 10-20% also have a sort of obstruction of the portal vein.
10621	Buerger's disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is a rare disease of the arteries and veins in the arms and legs. Buerger's disease is marked by a combination of inflammation and clots in the blood vessels, which impairs blood flow. This eventually causes damage or destroys tissues and may lead to infection and gangrene. Buerger's disease typically begins in the hands and feet and may progress to affect larger areas of the limbs. Buerger's disease is uncommon in the United States, but is more common in the Middle East and Far East. Buerger's disease most commonly affects males between ages 20 and 40, though it's becoming more common in women. Basically everyone diagnosed with Buerger's disease smokes cigarettes or uses other forms of tobacco. Quitting all forms of tobacco is the only way to stop Buerger's disease from developing. For those who don't quit, amputation of all or part of a limb may ultimately be required.
10622	A bulging disk is a medical condition in which the lower back area suffers intense pain when a disk enters a crevice in the spine. Disks are the soft tissues that serve as cushions of the spine.
10623	Bulimia nervosa, more commonly known as bulimia or "mia", is an eating disorder in which the subject engages in recurrent binge eating followed by feelings of guilt, depression, and self-condemnation. The sufferer will then take part in compensatory behaviors to make up for the excessive eating, which are referred to as "purging". Purging can take the form of fasting, vomiting, using of laxatives, enemas, diuretics or other medications, or overexercising.
10624	Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a skin disorder that is characterized by the chronic blistering of the skin. This condition ranges from the mildly itchy welts on the skin to more severe infection and blisters, and may affect a particular area of the body or spread all other, depending on the severity. This medical condition affects mostly elderly individuals but can also be seen on people of different ages.

10627	Bunyavirus is a type of virus which causes infection that results damage to the various organs of the person due to a viral infection carried by the Bunyaviridae which may be passed by mosquito bites.
10628	Burning mouth syndrome is a rather complex and highly vexing oral condition characterized by a burning sensation that occurs involving the lips, tongue, or the major areas of the whole mouth, for no apparent reason.This disorder has been associated with several numbers of other conditions such as psychological problems, menopause, disorders of the mouth, and nutritional deficiencies.
10629	Bursitis pertains to a painful inflammation of the bursae (small, fluid-filled sacs that lubricate pressure points) that often results from repetitive stress on the body's joints.
10630	Bursitis of the hip is the inflammation of the bursas in the hip bone or femur. Bursas are sacs that act as cushions to prevent friction among joints. Bursitis is commonly experienced in the shoulders as well as other joint areas.
10631	Bursitis of the knee is a condition characterized by inflammation of a bursa (tiny fluid-filled sac that reduces friction between moving parts of the knee) located near the knee joint.
10632	Calcific bursitis is the extreme inflammation of the joints due to calcification of the bones. Among the commonly affected areas are shoulders, hips, and calves. Tendons in these areas are likewise prone to damages.
10633	Byssinosis is more popularly as "brown lung", which is categorized as an occupational lung disease mainly caused by direct exposure and inhalation of cotton dust in some inadequately ventilated production site and working environment. Byssinosis is more common among factory workers employed in fabric and yarn manufacturing companies. This condition results to the narrowing of the lung's trachea and possible destruction of the lung tissue that can ultimately lead to respiratory failure.
10634	C syndrome is also known by another medical term opitz trigonocephaly syndrome, which is categorized as a very rare disorder typically transmitted as a result of a "gonadal mosaicism". This condition is present in people with different cells in its genetic makeup, usually with the number of chromosomes. The affected people are usually corn with some malformation of the head that typically displays a triangular shape which is largely due to the premature union of bones of the skull. Learning and developmental disabilities are also common in people with C syndrome.
10635	C. difficile (Clostridium difficile) is a type of bacterium that causes a widespread and serious illness. This bacterium can be found almost anywhere and can easily infect people.
10636	CADASIL, which stands for cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortial artifacts and leukoencephalopathy, is a type of inherited stroke disorder, usually attacks persons aged 30-50 years old. The disease is fatal, as patients usually die around 12 years after symptoms show. The disease affects the brain's small blood vessels. CADASIL also causes an abnormality in the muscle cells around the small blood vessels, called the vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to the destruction of the blood vessel cells. Patients typically have one parent who has CADASIL; as one copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition.
10637	Cafe au lait spots are generally birthmarks that are characterized by some brown cutaneous macules which are usually evident at birth and may strongly suggest possibility of Albright's syndrome or neurofibromatosis. The color of the birthmark may vary from dark to light brown with some irregular or smooth borders. Sizes of the spot can also vary and may possibly enlarge as the child grows.
10638	Calcification is a condition where there is a building up of calcium in the soft tissue causing said tissue to harden
10639	Calcinosis is a medical condition whereby there is a formation of calcium phosphates deposits in any soft tissue of the body.
10640	A term used to describe a group of disorders in which calcium deposits from in the skin, Calcinosis cutis or cutaneous calcification may result from a variety of factors. Occurring in soft tissues as a response to injury, dystrophic calcification is the most common source of this disease. Classified into 4 major types namely dystrophic, metastatic, iatrogenic and idiopathic, there are also rare types of Calcinosis cutis that have been variably classified as dystrophic or idiopathic. Such include calcinosis cutis circumscripta, calcinosis cutis universalis, tumoral calcinosis, and transplant-associated calcinosis cutis.
10641	Calciphylaxis is a highly morbid syndrome of vascular calcification and skin necrosis that is poorly understood. Mostly seen exclusively in patients with end stage renal disease, Caciphylaxis results in chronic non-healing wounds and requires parathyroidectomy and hyperbaric therapy. Considered as a rare but serious disease, calciphylaxis is a type of extraskeletal calcification that is similar to those observed among patients with hypercalcaemic states such as those with milk alkali syndrome, hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis and hypervitamino sis D.
10642	Calculi are stones that form in an organ or duct of the body. Stones are concretions of materials, usually mineral salts that can cause various important medical conditions.
10643	CAMFAK syndrome or CAMAK syndrome is only an acronym used to describing a rare and inherited neurological disease. It is characterized by peripheral and central demyelization of nerves, similar to that seen in Cockayne syndrome. The name "CAMFAK" is derived from the first letters of the characteristic findings of the disease: cataracts, microcephaly, failure to thrive, and kyphoscoliosis. However, the disease may also occur with or without failure to thrive and arthrogryposis. Among the first signs of the disease are low birth weight and a bird-like face. It is also typical for persons with CAMFAC to be intellectually deficit. Death may even occur within the first decade. Listed as a rare disease by the Office of Rare Disease (ORD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), CAMFAK syndrome only affects less than 200,000 people in the US population.
10644	Campylobacteriosis is an infection caused by the bacteria campylobacter or most commonly known as C. jejuni. Considered as among the most common human bacterial infections, it can be transmitted in several ways such as fecal-oral, person-to-person sexual contact and ingestion of contaminated food or water. When infected with the bacteria, an inflammatory and sometimes bloody diarrhea or dysentery syndrome may be experienced. It may include cramps, fever and pain. Campyolabacteriosis is usually self-limiting.
10645	Campylobacteriosis is an intestinal infection caused by bacteria called Campylobacter; commonly found in the stool of infected people and animals, processed food products contaminated in the process and preparation, poorly cooked chicken and other contaminated fruits that have not been hygienically prepared.
10646	Canavan Disease (also know as ACY2 deficiency) is a rare genetic defect that characterizes a spongy deterioration of the brain and spinal cord. The symptoms that indicate the spread of the disease develop at infancy, usually beginning with progressive mental decline and rapid loss of head control, balance and muscle tone. Affected infants have an abnormally large head caused by swelling. This disease is caused by an abnormality found in the ASPA gene that stops the cells from producing aspartocytase, an enzyme important in brain development.
10647	Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that is the most common cerebral degenerative disease of infancy. The disease causes progressive damage to the brain's nerve cells. It is also a gene-linked, neurological birth disorder, wherein the white matter of the brain disintegrate into spongy tissue puzzled with microscopic fluid-filled spaces. The disease belongs to a group of genetic disorders called leukodystrophies, which are characterized by the degeneration of myelin. Myelin is an electrically insulating dielectric covering the phospholipids layer of neuron insulating the axon. Canavan disease hinders the body's normal production of myelin. Called the central nervous system's "white matter," this fatty membrane ensures that nerve impulses are properly transmitted.
10648	Cancer is a group of diseases in which cells are hostile, invasive, and sometimes metastatic. These three are considered malignant properties of cancers that differentiate them from benign tumors. Although some benign tumor types are capable of being malignant, they are usually self-limited in their growth and don't invade or metastasize. People from all ages, even fetuses, may be affected with cancer but age is a factor that can raise the risks for more common varieties. About 13% of all deaths are caused by cancer and according to the American Cancer Society, 7.6 million people died from cancer in 2007 across the world. Even plants and animals may be affected by cancer. Abnormalities in the genetic material of the transformed cells practically cause all cancers. Carcinogens such as tobacco smoke, chemicals, radiation or infectious agents may have caused said abnormalities. Some however, may be randomly acquired through errors in DNA replication or inherited. DNA methylation and microRNAs are new aspect of the genetics of cancer pathogenesis that are gaining importance. The tissues from which the cancerous cells originate are used as bases in classifying cancer. There are also two general classes of genes affected by cancer anmely the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
10649	Cancer in children is a group of cancers that usually occur in children below 5 years of age. These cancers can be extremely fatal when not treated, just like the cancers that develop in adults. The most common cancers that affect children are blood-related, but other kinds include the brain and kidneys. These cancers are not caused by genetic disorders but rather of enzymatic or environmental reasons.
10650	Commonly called yeast infection or thrush, candidiasis is a fungal infection (mycosis) of any of the Candida species. The most common Candida specie is Candida albicans. Candidiasis includes infections that range from superficial, such as oral thrush and vaginitis, to systemic and potentially life-threatening diseases. The latter belongs to a category called candidemia are usually confined to severely immunocompromised persons. These include persons with cancer, transplant, and AIDS patients.

10656	Carbon monoxide poisoning is a condition resulting from exposure to a colorless, odorless, tasteless, yet potentially fatal gas known as carbon monixde.
10657	Carcinoid syndrome points to the collection of symptoms that happen next to carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors happen together along with gastrointestinal tract (GI) that are distinct, colored yellow and well-circumscribed tumors. The tumors usually affect the ileum, appendix and rectum and it is usually distinctive and endocrine in nature. The tumors produce hormones into the blood stream that go through to the end organs and operates then by proper receptors. Though it fairly unusual, out of 15 cases per 1,000,000 population carcinoid tumors report for 75% of GI endocrine tumors.
10658	Carcinoid tumors pertain to rare growths of potentially cancerous masses in several areas of the body. They most commonly occur in the lungs and in the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, appendix, small intestine, rectum, and colon.
10659	Carcinoma, squamous cell is a type of cancer of the carcinoma that may happen in several diverse organs which includes the skin, mouth, lips, esophagus, urinary bladder, prostrate, lungs and cervix. It is a nasty squamous epithelium, epithelium that presents differentiation in squamous cell.
10660	Cardiac amyloidosis is a medical condition that is a type of amyloidosis the reason of which is because of the deposits of an amyloid protein in the heart tissue that results to the reduced function of the heart.
10661	Cardiac arrest is also recognized as cardiorespiratory arrest, cardiopulmonary arrest or circulatory arrest and it is the sudden stop of normal flow of the blood because of the failure of the heart to contract efficiently during systole. Cardiac arrest varies from a heart attack or myocardial infarction where in the flow of blood to the still-beating heart is sporadic. The prevention of oxygen to be supplied to all parts of the body is referred to as "Arrested" blood circulation.
10662	Cardiac syndrome X is a kind of chest pain associated with reduced blood flow to the heart but the coronary arteries remain normal. This disorder is found to be an effect of other vasospastic problems such as Raynaud's phenomenon and migraine.
10663	Cardiac tamponade, is also known by another medical term as pericardial tamponade, which is characterized as an emergency condition where fluid accumulates in the sac that encloses the heart. The accumulation of the fluid can significantly elevate the heart's pressure and can ultimately lead to shock and possible death if without any medical intervention.
10664	Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome is a congenital anomaly characterized by mental retardation and marked with heart defects, ectodermal abnormalities as well as growth failure. This medical condition was first discovered in 1986, and to date, there are less than 300 recorded cases of this congenital disorder all over the world, and known to affect both sexes across all ethnic background.
10665	Cardiomyopathy is the deterioration of the function of the myocardium (i.e., the actual heart muscle) for any reason.
10666	Cardiospasm is the muscular failure among the esophagus and the stomach to open where in obstructing the passage of food into the stomach which causes the food to go into the esophagus.

10668	Carnitine transporter deficiency is a hereditary carnitine deficiency, which is a result of defective proteins. These proteins are called carnitine transporters. These transporters are responsible for carrying carnitine to wherever it's needed in the body, and prevents it from being excreted. With the deficiency, carnitine is released through urine. Illness or fasting may trigger severe attack.
10669	Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency is an uncommon fatty-acid oxidation disorder, which stops the body from transforming essential fatty acids to energy. Carnitine is generally acquired through one's diet, and is utilized by body cells in processing fats and producing energy. Individuals with this kind of deficiency have defective enzyme, preventing the transportation of fatty acids into the mitochondria's innermost part for processing.
10670	Caroli disease is categorized as an uncommon congenital disease that involves the cystic dilatation of the liver's intrahepatic bile ducts. It has two types, known as Simple Caroli disease and Complex Caroli disease. The first type is characterized by ectasia or dilatation of bile ducts, while the latter includes the presence of portal hypertension and hepatic fibrosis besides ectasia.
10671	Carotenemia is a condition of excess beta-carotene in one's blood. It's common and generally harmless in infants, usually appearing when they start eating solids. Ingestion of too much beta-carotene containing foods, deposits the carotene in one's skin adding yellow color to it. While the condition is not dangerous, it may lead to mistaken analysis of jaundice.
10672	Carotid artery dissection involves a tear in an inner artery lining, known as carotid artery. Carotid arteries supply blood to the brain, and are located in the neck's front portion. The condition may be critical, and needs immediate medical attention.
10673	Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition wherein the carpal tunnel's median nerve is pinched or entrapped due to swelling tendons or nerve or both. Carpal tunnel safeguards the major nerve to the hand, as well as the nine tendons responsible for bending the fingers. When pressure is placed on this major nerve, it causes pain, muscle weakness, and paresthesias in the hand and forearm.
10674	Carpenter syndrome is classified as a very rare or uncommon genetic disorder, distinguished through premature closure of skull bones, growth retardation, heart defects, craniofacial abnormalities, and other health disorders. It is usually manifests at/or shortly following birth.
10675	Castleman's disease is considered an uncommon illness affecting the lymph nodes and the body's immune-cell structures. The disease is categorized as lymphoproliferative disorder; meaning it involves overgrowth or proliferation of the lymphatic cells. While it's similar to lymphatic system cancers in many ways, Castleman's disease is non-cancerous. It has two types: Unicentric that involves one site of tissue growths, and Multicentric involving multiple sites of growths.
10676	Cat Eye syndrome is a very uncommon chromosomal disorder relating to chromosome 22 genetic abnormalities. The syndrome affects the eyes' appearance, and can be apparent at birth. Its name is derived from the distinctive eye abnormality present in affected individuals. This characteristic consists of the partial lack of coloboma or ocular tissue, which often affects both eyes.
10677	Cat-scratch disease is a communicable disease transmitted through the bacteria in a cat's saliva. The disease can be caught from a cat's bite or scratch, and may be passed on from cat to human. The disease isn't severe in healthy people, but it may be a problem for those who have a weak immune system.
10678	Catatonic schizophrenia is a subtype of chronic mental illness known as schizophrenia, which is characterized by altered perception of reality, behavior, and thinking. Patients with catatonic schizophrenia are typically extremely inactive or display minimal movements that seem disconnected from their surroundings. These episodes, known as catatonic episodes, may last for mere minutes or as long as a few hours.
10679	CATCH 22 syndrome comprises an extensive range of developmental defects linked to microdeletions of chromosomal area 22q11.2. More known examples of CATCH 22 phenotype are Velo-Cardio-Facial syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, and Opitz GBBB syndrome. The acronym CATCH 22 summarizes the major medical features of the 22q11.2 deletions.
10680	Catel Manzke syndrome is an uncommon genetic disorder combining glossoptosis, cleft palate, and micrognathia with an abnormality of the index fingers. Apart from the major features, there are also several related malformations described, particularly growth retardation and cardiac defect.
10681	Caudal regression syndrome is an uncommon disorder wherein the fetal spine's bottom portion does not properly develop. As a result, abnormalities that can be mild or severe occur. The syndrome can lead to various problems, varying from partial nonappearance of the spine's tailbone areas, to severe cases entailing significant malformation of pelvis, lower vertebrate, and spine.
10682	Causalgia is defined as a chronic pain disease that typically affects the leg or arm. It is characterized by reduced motion range of the hand and shoulder of an affected arm. In rare cases, it can involve other parts of the body.
10683	Cavernous hemangioma is a harmless propagation of the blood vessels, wherein there is a formation of a tumor-like mass of blood vessels in the internal organs or the skin. This vascular tumor is composed of huge quantity of blood. The usual "superficial" lesions have dark to bright red color; lesions that are deep are blue in color. This condition extends more intensely than capillary hemangioma, so spontaneous regression is less likely.
10684	Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a condition wherein there is formation of blood clot made up of fibrin and platelets in the brain's cavernous sinus. Cavernous sinus is found at the brain's base and contains several nerves, other structures, and a vein. This vein transports deoxygenated blood from face and brain then back to the heart. Associated conditions are craniocerebral trauma, thrombophilia, and infections of paranasal sinuses and contiguous structures.
10685	Some people are born with defects on their lower lip, and this may occur on the right or left side of the lip. This disease is Cayler Syndrome, also known as asymmetric crying facies. It is a disease wherein a congenital heart defect constricts the muscle movement of the lower lip. The controlled muscle movement is due to an underdeveloped muscle in the lip, or a complete absence of the muscle. Being congenital in nature, those afflicted are born with the disease, and is noticed in the infant when they cry or smile.
10686	When your child is born with a disease, knowledge about it will help you and your family cope with and learn how to raise the child as they need to. CDG, or congenital disorders of glycosylation, is a disease that affects the body's metabolic systems. It is also known by the name carbohydrate-deficient glycosylation syndrome. The central and peripheral nervous system are the most affected functions of those who are diagnosed with CDG syndrome.
10687	Celiac disease pertains to a digestive disorder set off by consumption of gluten, a type of protein that can be found in pasta, bread, pizza crust, cookies, and other food products that contain barley, wheat or rye.
10688	Genetics plays a significant role when it comes to the diseases we get or do not get in our lifetime. Among those that are determined by genetics, is celiac sprue, which affects the autoimmunity of the small bowel. Research has shown that an estimated 1% of patients come from Indo-European origins, although the disease still remains to be largely underdiagnosed.
10689	Cellulite is unsightly fat visible on the skin. Cellulite is dimpled in appearance and can be typically seen on the hips, thighs, and buttocks of women.
10690	Cenani Lenz syndactylism is a hereditary malformation syndrome that involves both the lower and upper extremity. It's an uncommon birth defect that's characterized by a variety of bone abnormalities. The syndrome was named after two medical geneticists; Turkish geneticist Asim Cenani, and German geneticist Widukind Lenz.
10691	Central diabetes insipidus is one of the two types of diabetes. The disease causes those afflicted to have extremely diluted urine, a result of a hormone deficiency vasopressin, an antidiuretic hormone. The condition disables the function of the kidneys to produce concentrated urine. Because of the excessive excretion of urine, people with central diabetes insipidus also show symptoms of extreme thirst for cold water. Dehydration is also a common symptom, since the body is unable to store water. The urine of patients also do not contain any glucose. In rare cases, central diabetes insipidus also causes blurred vision. Adults should be able to drink enough water to make up for the loss during extreme urination in order to keep healthy and live with the disease. Children who suffer from central diabetes insipidus show more drastic symptoms, such as diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. The disease also affects the child's growth, appetite, and eating functions. The disease may also occur gestationally, when women get pregnant but it disappears after labor. For one to be diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus, a number of tests are done concerning the blood glucose, calcium, and bicarbonate levels are conducted. Urinalysis is also conducted to determine the levels of electrolytes and urine osmolality, in which a person positive with central diabetes insipidus would have low results for both. An important tool in determining the cause of central diabetes insipidus is the fluid deprivation test. The disease can be caused by one of three factors: excessive liquid consumption, a disability in the production of the antidiuretic hormone, or if the cause lies in the kidney's reaction to the antidiuretic hormone. The test also makes use of a desmopressin stimulation to help in determining the main cause for the patient's condition. Should the patient be suspected of having central diabetes insipidus, further hormone testing of the pituitary is done. A magnetic resonance imagine, or MRI, is also conducted to determine what process is influencing the functions of the pituitary. Patients, including those with gestational cases, who are tested positive of central diabetes insipidus are treated with desmopressin. Those who develop gestational diabetes may also acquire the disease in their other pregnancies. For those who are diagnosed with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the desmopressin treatment will not be effective.
10692	Central diabetes insipidus is the body's deficiency of the antidiuretic hormone, causing too much production of extremely dilute urine. It is uncommon, and involves intense thirst and over urination. The condition indicates the kidney's inability to balance urine concentration.
10693	Central pontine myelinolysis is a neurological condition caused by damages incurred by the pons, the myelin sheath wherein the nerve cells in the brainstem are located.
10694	Central serous chorioretinopathy is a condition of the eye wherein the central macula leaks fluid from the choriocapillaris, resulting in blurry vision. The word serous means serum, which is thin and watery-like in texture. The blurry vision is called metamorphopsia. Sometimes the patients see gray or blind spots, as well as occurring photopsia, or flashes of light.
10695	Central sleep apnea is a condition characterized by breathing disturbances in sleep, often as a result of respirator weakness.
10696	Centronuclear myopathy belongs to a group of rare diseases called congenital myopathies. Congenital myopathies are conditions wherein the cell's nuclei is located within the skeletal muscle cells, an abnormal condition. Normally, the nuclei would be positioned in the periphery of the cell, but with centronuclear myopathy the nuclei is in the center, hence the name.
10697	Ceramidase deficiency, also known as Farber's Disease, is a group of genetically predisposed metabolic diseases named lipid storage diseases. The diseases characterize a condition wherein excessive amounts of lipids, such as fatty acids, oils, and other related substances, accumulate to harmful levels in the central nervous system, tissues, and joints. This may also affect the liver, heart, and kidneys. Ceramidase deficiency occurs in children when both parents have the protein-regulating gene sphingomyelin. Their children have a 25% chance of acquiring the disease, and a 50% chance of bearing the gene.
10698	Ceramide trihexosidosis is also known as Fabry's disease, and is a condition wherein an enzyme deficiency causes a fat storage disorder. This is because the enzyme deficiency affects the lipid biodegradation functions of the body.
10699	Ceraunophobia, known as the fear of lighting and thunder, is also known as astraphobia, tonitrophobia, and brontophobia. This specific type of phobia causes people distress and extreme upset when they encounter thunder or lightning.
10700	Cercarial dermatitis is a skin condition characterized by an itchy rash caused by certain parasites. It is also commonly referred to as "swimmer' itch".
10701	Cerebellar hypoplasia is a condition which affects the development of the cerebellum. The developmental problem actually results in an underdeveloped cerebellum, smaller than usual in size. Cerebellar hypoplasia may result because of genetics, or can also occur sporadically. The condition is associated with other diseases such as the Walker-Warborg syndrome, Dandy Walker Syndrome, and the Werdnig-Hoffman Syndrome.
10702	Cerebral vermis agenesis refers to the partial or complete malfunction of the brain's cerebellum due to the agenesis of the vermis. It is a congenital disorder.
10703	Cerebral or brain abscess is a mass of materials such as pus or immune cells that grow inside the brain due to fungal or bacterial infections.
10704	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a condition that affects the small blood vessels of the brain, wherein the amyloid protein associated with the Alzheimer's disease is deposited in the vessel walls. This may result in brain diseases such as dementia, brain hemorrhage, and stroke. Patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy are usually older than 65 years old, although it may also occur in those who are around 45 years of age. The disease prevalence increases with age, and equally affects both men and women. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is responsible for 5-20% of brain hemorrhage occurrences, and 30% of lobar hemorrhage.
10705	A cerebral aneurism occurs when the cerebral artery's wall weakens, causing the blood vessel to balloon abnormally and be filled with blood. This aneurism may put pressure on the tissue surrounding the brain, or the nearby nerves; it can also result in a rupture, called a brain hemorrhage. These can occur anywhere in the brain, but usually in the under part of the brain by the skull's base known as the Circle of Willis. When cerebral aneurisms are very small, they can go on without causing any problems.
10706	Cerebral cavernous malformation, sometimes known as cavernous angioma, is a disease that affects the central nervous system. The disease may occur sporadically or may be inherited. When one has the disease, there are groups of abnormal blood vessels located in the brain and spinal cord, although in rare cases they are also located in other parts of the body. A cerebral cavernous malformation resembles a raspberry, although it varies in size. The small bubbles are filled with blood, and a special layer of cells called endothelium lines the bubbles.
10707	Cerebral edema is an inflammation of the brain tissue due to pressure brought about by massive fluids that are collected within the brain. This condition can cause neurological problems and eventual death.
10708	Cerebral gigantism, also known as Sotos syndrome, is a rare hereditary disease characterized by excessive abnormal growth during birth, and extreme physical growth during early childhood years. The growth is purely physical, as there is no increased serum growth hormone levels. Sometimes, the condition may be accompanied by various levels of mental retardation, hypotonia, hindered motor, social, and cognitive development, and speech problems. Children born with cerebral gigantism are larger than normal during birth, and also possess a condition called macrocrania, where their heads are larger than normal. The disease may occur sporadically, or it can also occur in familial cases.
10709	Cerebral hypoxia occurs when the brain cannot get sufficient oxygen supply. Four classifications divide the other forms of cerebral hypoxia. A milder form of the disease is known as diffuse cerebral hypoxia, wherein brain impairment occurs due to low blood oxygen levels. Focal cerebral ischema is a localized reduction in the transport of oxygen from the blood to the brain. Mild strokes may occur, and the neuron damage in this case is irreversible. Cerebral infarction occurs when the oxygen flow from blood to a part of the brain is completely stopped, causing significant and irreversible brain damage. Global cerebral ischema is the last category, wherein the blood completely stops flowing to the brain.
10710	Cerebral palsy is a group of diseases that are non-progressive and non-contagious. The word cerebral refers to the cerebrum, and palsy means disorder of movement. Cerebral palsy is characterized by damaged motor control centers in the brains of young children. The brain damage that occurs does not worsen over time, although orthopedic difficulties may accompany the condition. There are 4 common classifications of cerebral palsy according to the damaged area of the brain. These are spastic, athetoid/dyskinetic, ataxic, and mixed. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type, and this type of cerebral palsy affects the motor cortex, corticospinal tract, or pyramidal tract, which leads to neuromuscular conditions. Patients with this type of CP also are hypertonic. Athetoid or dyskinetic type of CP have mixed muscle tone, and have either hypertonia or hypotonia. Ataxia, the least most common type of cerebral palsy, is characterized by tremors, hypotonia, and possibly some difficulties with motor skills.
10711	Cerebral thrombosis is defined as blood clot that takes place in the cerebral vessel. It is more commonly known as stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack or TIA. TIA is a "mini" or "warning" stroke, but doesn't have lasting damage. There are strokes that damage part of one's brain, and some have permanent injury. TIA is important in foreseeing if a "stroke" will happen and the chance to prevent it. They may occur several days, some weeks, or even a few months prior to a major cerebral thrombosis attack. In approximately half of the cases, stroke happens within a year from TIA.
10712	Cerebrocostomandibular syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is exhibited by a small jaw, palate deformities, improper positioning of the tongue and misplaced rib development. Some patients with this disorder soon develop mental retardation.
10713	Cerebrohepatorenal syndrome is a rare genetic disease characterized by the lack of peroxisomes, the cell structures that remove toxic substances from the body. Peroxisomes are found in the kidneys, liver and brain.
10714	Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare metabolic disease that affects the body's lipid storage system.
10715	Ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal is also known as Batten Disease and Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis. The name constitutes a family of 8 or more different neurodegenerative disorders which occur when lipopigments called lipofuscin, accumulate in the body's tissues. Fats and proteins make up the lipopigments, and they can accumulate in cells of body parts including the brain, eyes, muscle, and skin. The disease is quite rare, although they can occur in more than one member in a family if they possess the defective gene. The disorder is autosomal recessive in nature; meaning that if a child acquires the disease, both his parents have the defective gene. Parents who carry one defective gene result in each child having a one in four chance of inheriting the disease. Each of them also has a one in two chance of inheriting a copy of the gene. In adults, the CLN may be autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant form of the disease.
10716	Cerumen impaction pertains to an abnormal accumulation of earwax in the external ear canal. The earwax becomes too tightly packed to the point of causing an obstruction in the said canal.
10717	Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that affects the cervix, located in the lower part of the uterus. Cervical cancer falls under two classifications: squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. The cancers are classified according to how they look under a microscope, and squamous cell carcinoma occurs in 80-90% of cases.
10718	Cervical dystonia pertains to a painful condition characterized by involuntary contraction of neck muscles, which cause the head to twist or turn to one side. Cervical dystonia is also referred to as torticollis or spasmodic torticollis.
10719	Cervical osteoarthritis also known as cervical spondylosis is the deterioration of the bones and cartilage of the backbone and neck. The condition sometimes leads to the formation of bone spurs or irregular bony outgrowths.
10720	It is an inflammation of the cervix.
10721	Cestodes are parasitic internal parasites commonly known as tapeworms. They thrive on the feces of their host, and are a potential cause of gastrointestinal diseases. Cestodes also thrive in the gastrointestinal tract where they lay eggs.
10722	Chagas disease is a form of tropical parasitic disease, affecting persons in the Americas but most commonly in South America. The infectious agent in the disease is the Trypanosoma cruzi, which latch on to humans through the assassin bugs of the Triatominae. The disease is transmitted to humans through contamination in food, blood transfusion, and fetal transmission.
10723	A chalazion is a cyst that grows in the eyelid caused by the inflammation of the meibomian gland. These cysts vary in styes and are usually painless until they start to swell. They eventually heal and disappear on their own after a few days or weeks, but oftentimes it needs treatment in order to heal faster.
10724	Chancroid is a kind of sexually transmitted disease caused by bacteria. This STD is common in hot, tropical countries, and is characterized by open, painful sores in the genital area. When left untreated chancroid may give way to ulcers that may persist in the affected area for up to several months.
10725	Chandler's Syndrome (CS) is an eye disease which eats up the lining of cell inside the cornea causing the iris to dry up. This rare eye disorder is characterized by the swelling of the cornea as well as glaucoma. One of the three syndromes that dwell on the eyes, CS is more common to females than with males. At most times CS only affects one eye, but when left unattended, the other eye may be infected as well. Because of the glaucoma and leaking of fluids throughout the cell membrane would cause extreme pain and impaired vision.
10726	Chaotic Atrial Tachycardia, also known as Multifocal Atrial Tachycaridia is a disorder characterized by abnormal rapid heart rate. The fast heart rate occurs when too much electrical impulses flow to the different chambers of the heart, making it function faster than normal. It is as well linked to other heart disorders such as atrial fibrillation. This heart disorder produces a rhythm of varying P-wave morphology at irregular PP intervals. The heart rate is usually between 100 and 140 beats per minute, but in a Chronic Atrial Tachycardia, multiple locations within the atria rev up and initiate electrical impulses. These impulses are sent to the ventricles, leading to a faster heart rate from 100 to 250 beats per minute. This very fast rate then increases the heart's workload. Chronic Atrial Tachycardia is common in elderly patients especially those with pre-existing health problems and COPD.
10727	Lips that appear scaly, dry and may have one or more small cracks (fissures) are called chapped lips (cheilitis). They are often painful and there may or may not be swelling and redness.
10728	Charcot's Disease, or more commonly known as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the gradual death of motor neurons which control muscle movement. This illness usually causes muscle weakness and progressive atrophy, making the person lose his ablity to make voluntary movements in all parts of his body except for his eyes. Eventually the disease can lead to dementia and death.
10729	The Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is an inherited heterogeneous disease characterized by the death of muscle tissue and loss of touch sensation. It usually attacks the legs and feet but also triggers the arms and hands as the disease progresses. It is also known as Peroneal Muscular Atrophy or Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy, and is incurable at present. The disease is named after scientists who took the effort to do research on it, Jean-Martin Charcot and his student Pierre Marie, as well as Howard Henry Tooth.

10733	Chemophobia literally means a fear of chemicals. It is a fully-developed psychological fear of chemical substances due to pre-existing beliefs and hearsays about the negative effects of chemicals to one's body. However, some experts do not consider chemophobia as a psychological condition, but rather a term marketing analysts and advertisers coined in order to widen the market of the products they are selling.
10734	The Chen Kung Ho Kaufman McAlister Syndrome is a congenital defect where children are born with micrognathia, Wormian bones, cleft palate, congenital heart disease, dislocated hips, preaxial polydactyly of the feet, bowed fibulae, missing tibia and abormal skin patterns.

10736	Cherubism is a genetic defect which consists of the protruding bone tissue at the lower part of the face, particularly at the jaws. At the beginning of one's childhood, his upper and lower jaw grow at an abnormal rate and will soon be replaced by cyst-like bones. Because of this sudden enlargement of the jaws, the person's cheeks become swollen and rounded just like that of a cherubim, and will soon face problems with tooth growth. The condition varies among people; some cases of cherubism are quite mild and in fact unnoticeable, but in others the defect is so severe they even encounter difficulties in chewing, talking and seeing. However, these growths become replaced by normal bones as the children enter adulthood, and they will soon have a normal appearance as they reach maturity.
10737	It is a sudden feeling of pain in the chest.
10738	Chest wall pain is also referred to as costosternal syndrome, costosternal chondrodynia, or costochondritis. The condition is the inflammation of a cartilage that connects a rib to the breastbone.

It is also known as disintegrative psychosis or Heller's syndrome. It is similar to autism, but normal development is first seen before a sudden regression occurs. It is not easy to detect CDD on children during its early stages; the disorder would only be obvious when the child starts to lose his language skills. Some children seem to react to seizures and hallucinations, much to the surprise of their parents. This is often described as a devastating condition, since it affects the family's future. Child disintegrative disorder was first described by Thomas Heller in 1908.
10744	Childhood leukemia is one of the most common cancers that affect children. In this cancer, white blood cells dominate the bone marrow, wherein the red blood cells are produced. The lack of red blood cells in the body is life-threatening since it is the main factor that makes up the blood. This is a well-known cause of death when the disease is not treated.
10745	Childhood nephrotic syndrome is an illness characterized by the kidney's loss of protein in the urine. The condition then causes the blood protein to decrease allowing water movement into the tissues of the body resulting to edema or swelling usually around the eyes, belly, and legs.

10746	Schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness that causes people to communicate and behave differently than most other people through disorganized, detached, paranoid, or illogical behaviors.
10747	Chimerism is a rare disorder wherein chromosomes mix in a single organism. Because of this, a person with chimerism would have two DNA sets, as well as organs that do not match the person's DNA. Chimerism can be exhibited in hermaphrodites, in which the affected organism has both male and female sex organs. This disorder develops during the earliest stages of embryonic growth. Once chimerism forms two non-identical twin embryos merge as one rather than growing separately.
10748	The Chinese restaurant syndrome is a collection of ailments experienced by a person due to the lack of Vitamin B6.

It is an inflammation of the liver's bile ducts and leads to cholestasis, or the blockage of the bile transport towards the gut. This progresses to the accumulation of bile fluids which creates severe damages to the liver as well as jaunice and liver failure. The exact causes of PSC are not yet known. It is oftentimes linked with ulcerative colitis. PSC however differs from ulcerative colitis as it continues to thrive in the body even after the colon has been surgically removed.
10754	Cholecystitis is a disease characterized by the inflammation of the gall bladder. It is mainly caused by gallstones or choleliths which block the cystic duct. The blocking of the bile ducts leads to complications such as bile stasis, inspissation of the bile, and infection done by gut organisms. The disease takes place when the gall bladder's wall becomes swollen. Sometimes this inflammation may develop into necrosis and damage other structures such as the bowel and diaphragm.
10755	Cholelithiasis is the process of forming gallstones or choleliths in the body through accretion of bile components. They can develop anywhere in the biliary area such as a gallbladder and the bile duct. Once the bile duct becomes affected by this process it can cause choledocholithiasis, while obstruction of the biliary tree can lead to jaundice. The gallstones can also reach the pancreas, thus resulting to pancreatitis.
10756	Cholera is a contagious kind of gastroenteritis caused by a bacterium named Vibrio cholerae. It is transmitted to humans via contaminated food or water. The cholera-causing bacterium produces an enterotoxin that obstructs the small intestine leading to diarrhea. Cholera is one of most fatal diseases in history, and it can transform a healthy person into a hypotensive one in a matter of hours. When not treated immediately, patients may die from the disease within three hours after diagnosis.
10757	Cholestasis is a medical condition where the bile fluids cannot pass from the liver to the duodenum. This condition occurs when gallstones block the bile ducts due to side effects from other diseases or as a genetic defect in a person's DNA.

10764	Chondrodystrophy is a skeletal disorder caused by several genetic mutations that affect cartilage formation. It is characterized by a normal-sized body trunk but with shortened extremeties and limbs. People in this condition are often referred to as dwarves, and almost 1 out of 25,000 children is born with this disorder. In a normal cartilage development, hyaline cartilage covers the long bones as well as the spinal cord, and the limbs grow at the end of the long bones. The cartilage then develops into bone joints, but for a person with chondrodystrophy, this process would not happen and would lead to skeletal dysplasia.
10765	Chondroectodermal dysplasia, also known as Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, is a kind of skeletal dysplasia caused by a genetic disorder.
10766	A chondroma is a benign tumor with a lobular growth pattern. It is made up of tumor cells that produce the cartilaginous matrix, of amorphous, basophilic material.

10822	Cloacal exstrophy is a rare although severe birth defect where most of the abdominal organs, including the bladder and intestines, are exposed. The condition is named so, because the cloaca refers to the area in the embryo which eventually forms into the lower abdominal wall structures. When a child is born with cloacal exstrophy, a part of the large intestines is located outside of the body, and on one side lies the bladder in halves. In males, it occurs that the penis is short and flat, and sometimes cut in half; while with females, the clitoris is also cut in half. The condition may also result in two vaginal openings.

10837	Cold agglutinin disease is a form of hemolytic anemia, wherein there is a decrease in the levels of red blood cells caused by malfunction of the body's immune system. The body mistakenly creates antibodies that destroy healthy red blood cells during cold temperatures. Red blood cells normally have a 120-day lifespan before being disposed by the body's spleen; however, in people with the disease, they are prematurely destroyed and production in bone marrow can't compensate for the loss.
10838	Cold contact urticaria is defined as a long-term or chronic condition in which the skin forms hives that become very itchy and red when exposed to cold.

The disease is characterized by an impairment or absence in the body's automatic control for breathing. The patient's body forgets to breathe, even during sleep. The symptoms for congenital central hypoventilation syndrome can be mild or severe, but typical symptoms include abnormal pupils, which occur in 70% of cases; poor breathing functions especially during sleep, lack of spontaneous breathing, and bluish color in lips, nails, and skin due to breathing problems. Half of the patients with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome can breathe almost normally when they are awake; however, it is during sleep when they encounter difficulty breathing. Other characteristics to watch out for when diagnosing one with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome are: no muscular or respiratory problems that may cause the breathing difficulty; no heart disease; consistent poor breathing during sleep, and that the symptoms are noticed when the child is less than a year old and continues. Early diagnosis of the disease is important, because when it goes undetected, this may result in death. Once it is determined that a patient has congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, they can seek treatment for the disease. Prior to treatment, the patient will undergo a variety of tests, among the first will determine the severity of the problem. Other tests will determine the respiratory aspects of the disease, as well as neurological and cardiac tests. During the course of treatment, the patient will use breathing support apparatus, such a respirator. Some children may need to use it for 24 hours of the day. In more severe cases, patients undergo surgery that will allow them to use a surgical implant that provides electrical stimulation to the diaphragm muscle to help improve breathing. Studies show that genetics plays a role in the occurrence of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. Research also shows that since 20% of the cases are accompanied by Hirschsprung disease, that there is an underlying connection that can be found in the genetics of the patients. Children born with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome can still lead normal and active lives; however, extra supervision is needed during certain activities such as swimming when the body can forget to breathe when in the water.

Also known as "sleepy sickness" or as "sleeping sickness".EL is a dreadful illness that swept the world in the 1920s and then vanished as quickly as it had appeared. EL primarily attacks the brain, then leaving some of its victims in a rather statue-like condition, both motionless as well as speechless.

Unusual facial birthmarks as well as seizures are common with persons in this condition. Angiomas also develop inside the face, brain, jaws and eyes.
11177	Encopresis is the voluntary or involuntary passage of stools in children over age 4. This occurs when a child resists having bowel movements, causing impacted tool to collect in the colon and rectum. Liquid stool can leak around the impacted stool then out of the anus, which causes the soiling of the underwear. The condition is also called stool holding.
11178	End stage renal disease, or chronic renal failure, is the progressive damage of the kidneys. In this stage the renal organs no longer function therefore affecting renal excretion and other body activities.
11179	Endocardial cushion defect or also known as atrioventricular canal defect is a combination of several abnormalities in the heart that is congenital. In this condition, a hole between the chambers of the heart is present. There are also problems with the valves that regulate blood flow in the heart. The condition is also called atriventicular septal defect. There are two common types of atrioventricular canal defect. The fist one is partial, which means that only the two upper chambers of the heart are involved. The other one is called the complete form, which allows the blood to travel freely among all chambers but also lets extra blood circulate to the lungs, causing the heart to enlarge.
11180	Endocardial fibroelastosis is a rare heart disorder that is characterized by a thickening within the muscular lining of the heart chambers (the endocardium) due to an increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue and elastic fibers. It is considered to be a rather uncommon cause of some unexplained types of heart failure among infants and children.
11181	Endocarditis is characterized as an inflammation of the inner layer of the patient's heart, which is medically termed as the endocardium. Among the most common structures of this medical condition involves the heart valves.
11182	Endocarditis occurs when bacteria settles in the heart. Because the valves of the heart don't have any blood supply of their own, mechanisms for defense such as the white blood cells cannot enter into the heart. In such case, if an organism like bacteria hold on the valves, which normally the body will not be able to get rid of.
11183	Endocrinopathy is a disorder associated with an endocrine gland. It is also often known as a hormone imbalance. It is a collective term for diseases in the endocrine glands associated with hormones
11184	Endometrial cancer is cancer that starts in the lining of the uterus called the endometrium. It is one of the most common cancers in American women. About 40,000 American women receive a diagnosis of endometrial cancer each year, which makes it the fourth most common cancer found in women.
11184	Endometrial cancer is a common type of cancer affecting most American women. Roughly forty thousand American women are diagnosed per year, making it the 4th most common female cancer. It begins in the lining of the uterus (called the endometrium), and may also affect other cells of the uterus. It is alternatively known as uterine cancer, and usually appears as the female's reproductive period ends, usually at ages 60-70.
11185	An endometrial polyp or uterine polyp is a polyp or lesion in the lining of the uterus or the endometirum, which takes up space within the uterine cavity. Ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters in size, polyps are attached to the uterine wall by a large base or a thin stalk.
11186	Endometriosis is a very common condition of women characterized by a growth outside the uterus of the endometrium which is the tissue that lines the uterus. This disorder is known to have affected women who are around 30 to 40 years old and who have not experienced being pregnant. These women are of reproductive age all around the world. This disorder, however, can occur just rarely in women at their postmenopausal age. In Endometriosis, the endometrium, which is misplaced, is unable to get out of the body. Although the tissues will still detach from the wall and bleed, but the result is internal bleeding, the surrounding areas swell, pain, shedding of blood and tissue, and scar tissue formation.
11187	Endomyocardial fibrosis otherwise known as EMF is a kind of disease, progressive, which is due to unknown origin or idiopathic that is known to affect the heart seriously. The most obvious feature of this disease is a great change in the lining of the heart cavities known as the endocardium in one or can be both of the chambers of the heart in the lower part. It may also involve the heart valves found between the four chambers of the heart including the tendon-like cords holding the valves to the ventricles. Endomyocardial fibrosis is also similar to Loeffler's disease. Some regard Loeffler's disease as an early stage of the EMF, however, this idea remains to be controversial. This is one form of the Hypereosinophilic syndrome
11188	Enetophobia is described as "a persistent, unwarranted, and abnormal fear of pins." Every year this very common phobia or fear causes so many people distress of being needless. To make things worst for such very distressing condition, most therapies usually take months or even years which at times will even require the person frequent and countless exposure to his fear. It is believed that the procedure is not only unnecessary, it also often worsen the condition. It is really cruel the fear can be eliminated with just 24 hours of commitment provided the right method is done to the patient.

11199	Also known as bed-wetting, nocturnal enuresis of nighttime incontinence is a developmental stage and is not a sign of toilet training gone bad. Primary enuresis is the term for children who have never been dry at night. Those who begin to wet the bed after at least six months of dry nights are considered to have secondary enuresis.
11200	Eosinophilia refers to a condition where high levels of eosinophils are found in the blood. Among the causes of the condition are diseases such as hypereisinophilic syndrome, allergic disorders, Hodgkin's disease, drug reactions and cholesterol embolization.
11201	Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome or EMS is an incurable neurogical condition. Sometimes this conditon is fatal to some patients. It is flu-like condition that is associated to be triggered by ingestion or consumption of L-tryptophan supplements which are poorly produced. Like the regular eosinophilia, it can cause increase in the eosinophil granulocytes present in the patient's blood. There are new developments though, another explanation for EMS claims that it is brought about by the consumption of large amount of tryptophan. It leads to the production of the metabolites, which can interfere with the normal degradation of histamine. Also too much activity of histamine has been associated and related to blood eosinophilia and myalgia.

11203	Eosinophilic fasciitis also called EF, is a form of a fascia inflamation. It is different from scleroderma because most of the time the area affected is the fascia and not the dermis as in the case of scleroderma. Also, not like scleroderma when the patients manifests the Raynaud's phenomenon and the telangiectasia, patients are not observed to have those manifestations. This disease is more commonly observed in men and less likely in women. Some cases have also been reported to have occured after a strenuous exercise

It is also classified into different clasifications like serosal, mucosal, and muscular types basing on the involvement depth. For this condition, any part of the gastrointestinal tract may be affected. Also an involvment of the isolated biliary tract was reported. Most of the time it is the stomach that is commonly affected, then the small intestine and then the colon

Most of the time, the location of the tumor in children is in the intracranial, while the location of the tumor is in the spinal in the case of adults. The most common location of the intracranial ependymoma is in the fourth ventricle. It is only very rarely that ependymoma occurs in the pelvis or in the pelvic cavity. It is believed that Ependyomoma may have cause Syringomyelia. These tumors are also seen with Type 2 Neurofibromatosis.

Not all of epilepsy syndrome cases occur in a lifetime. Some forms of this disorder are only confined to some certain stages of childhood. Epilepsy, however, should not be considered or interpreted as a single disorder, rather occur as a group of syndromes with widely divergent symptoms which are all involving an episodic, abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
11218	Epilepsy in children refers to the random seizures experienced by children from time to time. These seizures are caused by abnormal neurological transmissions that occur in the brain.

11270	Swimmer's ear or external otitis is an infection of the outer ear and ear canal. This happens when the ear is exposed to excess moisture and water is trapped in the ear canal. The acidity that normally prevents infection is diluted because the skin becomes soggy. Cuts along the lining of the ear can also cause bacteria to penetrate the skin.
11271	Supernumerary nipples, or extra nipples, are additional nipples that have developed in one's mammary area. They appear along vertical milk lines near the armpits. They are often mistaken as moles. These nipples however, do not perform the same functions as normal nipples. Among the famous personalities with extra nipples are actor Mark Wahlberg and American Idol singer Carrie Underwood.
11272	Extradural, or epidural hematoma, is the clotting of blood between the brain's dura mater and the skull. This condition can be fatal due to the pressure brought about by the buildup of blood which compresses the brain tissue.

It affects the frontal area of the uvea, particularly in the iris and ciliary body, as well as in the back portion of the uvea, particularly in the choroids layer. Melanoma is more commonly associated with skin cancer; however, it can also develop in an individual's eyes, as in the case of eye melanoma cancer. It may occur in the form of a primary eye cancer, which means that the melanoma originated in the eye; or as a secondary eye cancer, in which the melanoma has spread to the eye from some other part of the body.

Factor V functions as an enzyme cofactor; the deficiency will lead to a tendency for hemorrhage, while some mutations influence thrombosis.
11291	Factor V Leiden mutation is a widespread clotting disorder caused by the mutation of a gene in the clotting of Factor V. The mutation results to Factor V responding more gradually to Protein C. Protein C is an anti-clotting aspect that usually controls Factor V activity. Consequently, individuals with Factor V Leiden mutation have increased risks of thrombophilia or blood clots.
11292	Factor VII deficiency is an uncommon disorder that's hereditary in which there is a lack of sufficient plasma protein Factor VII. The deficiency leads to coagulation or abnormal clotting of the blood. Clinical bleeding may vary widely and doesn't always associate with Factor VII coagulant activity level. FVII is among the Vitamin K group that's synthesized inside the liver.

This condition is frequently referred to as IBGC or 'idiopathic basal ganglia calcification', as there's no obvious explanation for calcification within these regions of the brain.
11298	Vasovagal syncope is the most common type of fainting. There are a number of different syncope syndromes; all which falling under the umbrella of vasovagal syncope. The central mechanism leading to loss of consciousness is the common element among these conditions. The only difference among them is the triggering factors.

11300	Fallen bladder is also called cystocele. This condition occurs when the wall in between the bladder and the vagina becomes weak allowing the bladder to fall into the vagina and causing problems emptying the bladder. A bladder that dropped off from the normal position may cause problems unwanted leakage of urine and the bladder emptied incompletely. A fallen bladder also stretches the opening of the urethra which cause urine to leak out when coughing, sneezing, laughing, or any movement putting pressure on the bladder.

Affected individuals develop countless 'adenomatous colorectal polyps' in the rectum or colon, particularly during their teenage years and twenties. The polyps aren't cancerous, but due to their numerous quantities, there's greater chance that a number will go through mutation and trigger cancer development.
11303	Familial amyloid polyneuropathy, otherwise known as Corino de Andrade's Disease, is a deadly and untreatable health condition that was first identified in the 1950s. This disease is characterized by amyloidogenic transthyretin protein that aer systematically deposited particularly in the peripheral nervous system of the body.

11320	Fatty liver is a condition that involves the accumulation of too much fat in one's liver cells. It's normal for the liver to have some fat; however, if this fat makes up more than ten percent of the weight of the liver, then one has a fatty liver and can develop more grave symptoms. The extra fat can lead to liver inflammation.
11321	Favism, also known as glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, is an X-linked recessive disease that demonstrates insufficient amounts of the G6PD enzyme. This enzyme is important to red blood cell metabolism. Patients with the disease may suffer from non-immune hemolytic anemia.
11322	Fazio Londe syndrome is an uncommon hereditary 'motor neuron' disorder found in young adults and children. The disease is distinguished by progressive weakness of the muscle that ultimately results to untimely death. Neuromuscular transmission in these muscles might be abnormal due to immature reinervation and rapid denervation. The disease can progress to an affected person's death in as short as nine months, or can have slow evolution.
11323	Febrile convulsions are a kind of convulsion that last only a few minutes. Unlike epileptic convulsions, febrile convulsions are not dangerous. They are caused by body reactions towards infections. They do exhibit the same characteristics as other seizures, such as labored breathing, drooling and clenched teeth.
11324	Febrile seizure usually happens in young kids and babies and it is because of high body temperature and fever. Luckily, when a child or a baby experiences febrile seizure it does not result to damage in the brain or any severe complications. Although, a baby that has febrile seizure should be attended immediately by a physician because the baby has a serious fever in this case. Even though the baby has a fever he need not be admitted but the physician must closely monitor the condition of the baby.

In some cultures fetishism is a form of religious practice in order to worship gods or deities. In individuals however, this behavior involves an extreme want for a certain item, which, the person deeply identifies him with. Fetishism can be a part of one's sexual fulfillment; others meanwhile regard this behavior as making their life complete.

It typically occurs as a soft-tissue mass or a bone tumor. There are generally two main types of fibroscarcoma: primary and seconday. The former involves a fibroplastic malignancy producing varying amounts of collagen. Secondary fibrosarcoma results from a preexisting lesion.
11356	Fibrosis is a condition wherein there is a thickening of fibrous connective tissues - which is usually caused by an injury. A formation of a scar tissue occurs to replace damaged tissues. There are two main types of fibrosis - one is Pulmonary Fibrosis, while the other is Cystic Fibrosis. In pulmonary fibrosis, there will be an observed hardening or scarring of lung tissue. This is due to an excess in collagen. A variation of this is Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis - with this however, the cause is unknown. In Cystic Fibrosis, it is a chronic disease of the body's mucus glands - where at times it could be fatal.
11357	Fibrous dysplasia is characterized as a type of bone disorder in which case the scar-like tissue gradually develops in place of the bone. So as the bone gets bigger, the fibrous tissue correspondingly expands with it and thereby weakening the bones. This medical condition can result to deformed and brittle bones.
11358	Also commonly called as parvovirus infection or erythema infectiosum is a fifth of the common childhood diseases with similar rashes. Other four are measles, rubella, scarlet fever and duke's disease. With a compromised immune problem or with certain anemia's this disease can be also serious to people.

The bacteria are commonly found in waters, particularly in swimming pools, and people exposed to salt or fresh water are more susceptible to the disease. Fish tank granuloma can be treated with antibiotics such as doxycyclin, and rifampin.
11363	Fissured tongue characterized as a benign medical condition that often referred to as plicated or scrotal tongue. It is distinguished as a tongue with deep or shallow furrows or grooves causing a rather wrinkled appearance of the tongue. This condition may be congenital and may gradually increase with age.

The inflammation can also take place on the female vaginal cavity. Fistulas can be congenital or acquired, depending on the case.
11364	Fistula is the inflammation of cavities and passages that connect one organ to another. The areas where fistulas are prone to occur are the neck, gall bladder and salivary glands. The inflammation can also take place on the female vaginal cavity. Fistulas can be congenital or acquired, depending on the case.
11365	Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is characterized by pain that is typically felt on the right upper quadrant that is a result of an ascending infection of the pelvis and inflammation of the diaphragm or liver capsule. This medical condition is typically associated with another disease called acute salpingitis and usually mimics typical abdominal emergencies. Since there are a number of possibilities that may be associated with the symptoms of this disease, proper diagnosis is required to rule out other possibilities.
11366	Fitzsimmons-Guilbert syndrome is considered as an extremely rare genetic disease that is characterized by a considerably slow progressive spastic paraplegia, along with skeletal anomalies of the feet and hand with brachydactyly type E. This also comes with cone-shaped epiphyses, sternal anomaly, abnormal metaphyseal-phalangeal pattern profile, mild intellectual deficit and dysarthria. To date, there are only three reported cases of this disease, two of which suffered from severe mental retardation.
11367	A flaky scalp is usually a result of dandruff, a chronic condition wherein the skin on the scalp flakes off in unusually large amounts. A flaky scalp may be due to fungal development on the skin, or excess secretion from the scalp's sebaceous glands. Flaky scalps can be treated with a medicated shampoo.
11368	Flatfeet or also known as Pes planovalgus, is a condition where the arch or instep of the foot collapses and comes in contact with the ground. This arch never develops in some individuals.
11369	Flatulence or flatus is passing of intestinal gas which generally everyone passes gas at least 12 times or more. Flatus usually isn't serious, but sometimes unexpelled gas can cause intense, intermittent pain in the abdominal region.
11370	Flavimonas oryzihabitans is considered to be a very uncommon bacterial infection that typically occurs in immunocompromised patients or those who are required to use catheters. Flavimonas oryzihabitans was previously named Pseudomonas oryzihabitans. Pseudomonas is a non-fermenting, ixidase-negative and gram negative bacillus which is normally found in sink drains, rice paddies and constantly damp environments.
11371	Flea bits are itchy spots that occur on the skin due to bites of parasitic insects called fleas.
11372	Flesh eating bacteria is a very rare but very serious bacterial infection medically known as necrotizing fasciitis. This type of infection typically starts in the body tissues that are just below the skin and gradually spreads along the different layers of body tissues such as fat and muscle. This is considered as a highly dangerous infection and is usually found on the legs, arms and abdominal wall, making it a very fatal medical condition.
11373	Floating-Harbor syndrome is a rare genetic disease that usually features a short stature among infants. Affected children suffer from delayed bone age, slow development of expressive language abilities, and a triangular shaped face. It is an autosomal dominant disorder that was first described in 1973.
11374	Floppy valve syndrome or also known as Mitral valve prolapse is characterized by the displacement of an abnormally thickened mitral valve leaflet into the left atrium during systole. MVP, in its nonclassis form, carries a low risk of complications. Severe cases of MVP though may include complications such as infective endocarditis, regurgitation and in rare circumstances, cardiac arrest that usually results to sudden death. The term for the disease was coined by J. Michael Criley in 1966. It gained acceptance over JB Barlow's ?billowing? of the mitral valve description. MVP has different subtypes namely classic, nonclassic, symmetric, asymmetric, flail or non-flail. The subtypes are based on the leaflet thickness, convacity and type of connection to the mitral annulus.
11375	Flourosis is actually not a medical disorder, not more of a cosmetic condition. Quite often, the condition is so mild, only professional dentists are able to detect it. This is largely brought about by the excessive fluoride in the body that can become a disruptive agent in enamel formation of the teeth. This can cause some minor discoloration or teeth surface irregularities.
11376	Influenza or flu is a viral infection that attacks the respiratory system including the nose, throat, bronchial tubes, and lungs. Though it is commonly called flu, influenza is not the same virus that causes diarrhea and vomiting.
11377	Flynn-Aird syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder that is characterized by gradual neurological degeneration that is associated with symptoms such as ataxia, dementia, eye problems, muscle wasting and skin disorders.
11378	Focal dystonia or the neurological condition that affects the muscle or muscles of the body, is thought to start in the thin tissue wrapped around the brain.
11379	Focal seizures, or partial seizures, are a kind of seizures in which only a small part of the brain is affected. It is usually a precursor of a bigger seizure such as a tonic-clonic seizure. Focal seizures are divided into two types; complex partial seizures and simple partial seizures. Focal seizures are as well common in temporal lobe epilepsy.
11380	Foix-Alajouanine syndrome is a spinal cord disease (a rare type). Foix-Alajouanine syndrome is a disorder caused by an arteriovenous malformation of the spinal cord. This often results to painful paralysis and muscle tone loss. It commonly afflicts people ages 20 to 40 years. If not promptly and properly treated, death may result within one to two years.
11381	Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome is a partial paralysis on the face, the pharynx and the jaw. Affected areas are still capable of certain movements like eating, smiling, and facial movements. Upper and lower limbs are usually unaffected. This syndrome is caused by blood supply loss or interruption in a specific part of the brain. This condition is also called bilateral anterior opercular syndrome. It was discovered in the year 1926 by Charles Foix, Jean Alfred ╔mile Chavany and Julien Marie.
11382	Folate deficiency refers to the insufficient amount of folic acid in the body. The effects of folate deficiency are often subtle.
11383	Folate-deficiency anemia, classified under vitamin deficiency anemia, is the decrease in red blood cells caused by folate deficiency.
11384	Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a certain type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) which is most common among the group (about one in four reported cases). It is a lymphoma (or cancer) of the B-lymphocytes. Average age of patients are in their sixty's but it can occur at anytime in one's adult life. It is both commonly equal in women and men.
11385	Infection of the hair follicles is called folliculitis. It is characterized by the appearance of the small, white headed pimples around one or more hair follicles which are superficial in most cases of infections.
11386	Folling disease, also known as phenylketonuria (PKU), is a rare metabolic defect characterized by mental incapacities and eventual brain damage.
11387	While there are some people who have bad reactions to certain food, the real food allergy is actually triggered by the body's immune system and is known to be a rare condition. The hypersensitivity to food can cause a number of serious problem and can even lead to death.
11388	Food intolerance is an adverse reaction of the body to certain foods. A person may experience sudden reactions such as spasms, abdominal pain and weakness each time he consumes a certain kind of meal. This may be caused by an enzyme deficiency which should function to accommodate the food in the body's digestive tract. Food intolerance should not be confused with food allergy since it is not an autoimmune reaction.
11389	Food poisoning is an illness resulting from eating foods contaminated with viruses and bacteria. Depending on the kind of strain ingested by the victim, food poisoning can result to life-threatening diseases such as hepatitis A and dehydration.
11390	Foodborne illnesses are any kind of illness associated with consumption of contaminated food. It is also known as food poisoning.
11391	Sometimes called drop foot, foot drop is a general term used to describe the difficulty in lifting the front part of the foot and cases of dragging the front of the foot on the ground when walking. Foot drop is a sign of an underlying cause such as neurological, muscular, or anatomical problem and is not a disease.
11392	Foot ulcers are lesions that can lead to serious neuropathy when left untreated. This is commonly experienced by patients with diabetes.
11393	Forbes Disease occurs in 1 for every 100,000 live births. It is also called Cori's type III glycogenosis. It was Gerty Theresa Radnitz Cori and Gilbert Burnett Forbes who developed an accurate description of this condition. This rare disease is due to a missing enzyme which causes abnormal glycogen levels to be absorbed by the body, namely the liver and the skeleton musculature.
11394	Normal large, superficial sebaceous (oil-producing) glands seen on the moist tissue that lines some organs and body cavities (mucosal surfaces) are called Fordyce spots. Most commonly found at the border of the lips, the inner foreskin and on the head of the penis, the spots are asymptomatic. The lesions are also asymptomatic, but irritation or itching may happen if people treat the bumps inappropriately.
11395	Also known as Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), Forestier's disease is the hardening of the tendons and ligaments that commonly affects the spine. Some people may experiences Forestier's disease beyond the spine since it can also affect tendons and ligaments in the heels, ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows and hands.
11396	Formaldehyde is a highly toxic and flammable gas (when at room temperature). It has an irritating and penetrating odor that may or may not be easily detected. It is more commonly used for formalin solutions. Exposure to and contamination from harmful concentrations of this substance can cause Formaldehyde poisoning.
11397	Fountain syndrome is extremely rare. It is a disorder which can be inherited. It is autosomal recessive. It is observed to be more common in men than in women.
11398	A rare disorder, Fox-Fordyce disease becomes a problem for most women who fall between ages 13 to 35 years. Males and young children may also develop this medical problem. Fox-Fordyce Disease is also called 'sweat retention disease' and 'apocrine duct occlusion'.
11399	Greenstick fracture occurs when the bone cracks but does not break all the way through. This condition is common among children since a child's bones are more flexible and softer.
11400	Growth plates are the softer parts of a child's bones located at each end of the bone, where growth occurs. Growth plates are the weakest sections of the skeleton and since they are very fragile, an injury that would result in a joint sprain for an adult can cause a fracture in a child.
11401	Tiny cracks in a bone are called stress fractures and are most common in the weight-bearing bones of the lower leg and foot. Particularly susceptible to stress fractures are track and field athletes but anyone can experience the condition.
11402	A fractured femur is an injury of the thigh bone. The femur is one of the strongest bones of the human skeleton, and it connects the hip and knee joints.
11403	Fragile X Syndrome is a defect in the X chromosome. This condition is the cause of mental retardation in people. People with defective X chromosomes exhibit various signs and symptoms. Those who have this body condition possess chromosomes which are fragile, prone to tear and break downs. Fragile X syndrome affects 1 in every 2,000 males.
11404	Frambesia, also known as yaws, is a chronic infectious disease common in places with tropical climate. It often affects children below 15 years of age.
11405	Francois Dyscephalic Syndrome is also known as the Hallermann-Streiff syndrome and the Oculomandibulofacial Syndrome. This is a disorder which greatly affects one's body stature, the head structure, and also hair growth. Patients who suffer from this kind of condition are often shorter than average people. They may be unable to develop facial hair and hair in other places such as the legs and the pubic areas. Many others have persisting problems with teeth development with some only developing one set in a lifetime.
11406	Fraser Syndrome is also called Cryptophthalmos-syndactyly syndrome. It is a rare genetic disorder with abnormalities that include that of the head, the lungs, the kidneys, and the limbs. Malformations are a combination of acrofacial and urogenital ones which may be with cryptophthalmos or without.
11407	FRAXA Syndrome (also, Fragile X) is a cause of mental retardation most commonly inherited by males in the family. It is the most commonly observed cause of autism.
11408	Freeman-Sheldon Syndrome is a multiple congenital contracture syndrome. It is the rarest of all MCC syndromes and is the most severe among forms of distal arthrogryposis. Freeman-Sheldon Syndrome is also called whistling-face syndrome and distal arthrogryposis type 2A (DA2A
11409	Frey's syndrome is also known as Frey-Baillarger syndrome, Dupuy's syndrome, and Baillarger's syndrome. It is food related and can be congenital and also non-congenital. Some cases of this condition may persist for life.
11410	Friedreich's Ataxia is inherited. It damages the body's nervous system, the damage being of a progressive nature. It was Nicholaus Friedreich who in the 1860's named the condition "Ataxia" to mean coordination problems like clumsiness and unsteadiness. Continual degeneration of nerve tissues in one's spinal cord causes it to thin overtime. This condition also affects nerves responsible for arm and leg muscle movements.
11411	Frigidity, also known as inhibited sexual desire (ISD), is a manifestation of sexual aversion. It is a condition where a person no longer reacts responsively to sexual stimuli. Persons who are thought to be frigid show signs of indifference towards sexual intercourse.
11412	Froelich's syndrome is an acquired medical condition involving endocrine abnormalities especially in the hypothalamus. Often associated with tumors in the hypothalamus, this syndrome commonly affects males only. It usually manifests during childhood, especially during puberty with occasional reports during the postadolescent period. Froelich's syndrome is also known by other synonyms such as Adiposogenital Dystrophy, Babinski-Froelich Syndrome, Dystrophia Adiposogenitalis, Frolich's Syndrome, Hypothalamic Infantilism-Obesity, Launois-Cleret Syndrome, and Sexual Infantilism.
11413	The second most common type of epilepsy after temporal lobe epilepsy, Frontal lobe epilepsy is similar to temporal lobe epilepsy because it is a type of focal seizure, which means that the seizure starts in a focal area of the brain, commonly referred to as the focus. Frontal lobe epilepsy means that the focus is located in the frontal lobe.
11414	The second most common type of epilepsy after temporal lobe epilepsy, Frontal lobe seizures is similar to temporal lobe epilepsy because it is a type of focal seizure, which means that the seizure starts in a focal area of the brain, commonly referred to as the focus. Frontal lobe epilepsy means that the focus is located in the frontal lobe.
11415	Frontotemporal demential is considered to be a clinical syndrome wherein the cause of the condition is due to a degeneration of the brain's frontal lobe and extends to the temporal lobe. This syndrome can occur in patients diagnosed with a motor neuron disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. It often occurs in people of young age. When FTD is diagnosed together with MND, the prognosis is worse.
11415	Frontotemporal dementia is a general umbrella medical term to a diverse group of rare disorders that primarily affects the temporal and frontal lobes of the brain. These are the areas that are generally associated with individual personality and behavior. It usually affects the younger people and are known to undergo very rapid changes in the personality and usually become socially inappropriate.
11416	Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a pathologic process involving degeneration of gray matter in the frontal lobe and anterior part of the temporal lobe of the cerebrum, with sparing of the parietal and occipital lobes.
11417	Frostbite, known in medicine as congelatio, is a condition characterized by damage to the skin and other tissue caused by exposure to extremely low temperatures, particularly temperatures below the freezing point.
11418	Frozen shoulder, also called adhesive capsulitis, is a condition marked by stiffness and pain in your shoulder joint. As the condition progresses, the shoulder's range of motion becomes markedly reduced. Frozen shoulder typically affects one shoulder at a time, although some people may eventually develop frozen shoulder in the opposite shoulder.
11419	Fructose intolerance is also known as fructose poisoning which is a condition that can be inherited. This disorder is marked by a liver enzymes deficiencies specifically those responsible to metabolize fructose. Another name for the disorder is hereditary fructosemia.
11420	This disorder is also known as essential fructosuria and hereditary fructosuria often seen in children. It is caused by a hepatic fructokinase deficiency which leads to excretion of fructose in urine. Fructosuria is a benign condition, since fructose is not broken down to glucose; it is simply excreted out of the system in urine. Fructosuria is unlike Fructosemia which means fructose in the blood. The latter is a more serious condition that can cause growth abnormalities and even coma in some severe cases. Unlike fructosuria, fructose in Fructosemia is converted to fructose-1-phosphate which uses up the body's ATP stores. This will prevent the proper release of glucose from glycogen, uses up the free phosphate available in the body, and causes uric acid levels to rise.
11421	Dissociative fugue is a rare condition in which a person suddenly, without planning or warning, travels far from home or work and leaves behind his or her past life. Patients show signs of amnesia and have no conscious understanding or knowledge of the reason for their leave. The condition is usually linked with severe stress or trauma. Since persons cannot remember all or part of their past, at some point they become confused about their identity and the situations in which they find themselves. In rare cases, they may adopt on new identities. `
11422	Acute liver failure (or fulminant liver failure) is the appearance of severe complications rapidly after the first signs of liver disease (such as jaundice), and indicates that the liver has sustained severe damage (loss of function of 80-90% of liver cells).
11423	Fumarylacetoacetase deficiency disease is a rare metabolic disorder in which the blood and urine lack a certain kind of enzyme called tyrosine. Tyrosine is one of the enzymes needed by the body to perform normal body functions. Fumarylacetoacetase deficiency disease one of the three types of tyrosine deficiency disorders: Type I tyrosinemia is characterized by episodic lethargy, bleeding, hepatic necrosis and seizures due to the lack of fumarylacetoacetase.
11424	An infection of nail fungus develops when fungi infect one or more of the nails. A nail fungal infection may begin as a white or yellow spot under the tip of the fingernail or toenail. As the nail fungus spreads deeper into the nail, it may result to nail discoloration, thickening and developing of crumbling edges - an unsightly and potentially painful problem.
11425	Fungal meningitis is the swelling of the brain tissue and the spinal cord. It usually develops on persons with weak immune systems.
11426	Funnel chest is a congenital deformity wherein several ribs grow in such a way that they produce a sunken appearance of the chest. This abnormal development usually begins during puberty.
11427	G6PD is an inherited disorder wherein the body's cells are unable to produce a sufficient amount of the enzyme glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase or G6PD. This enzyme is important in supporting the red blood cells in their activities. This deficiency may lead to hemolytic anemia especially when the patient is exposed to certain drugs and infections.
11428	A galactocele is a cystic tumor in the breast that contains a milky substance, or even milk. This disorder usually occurs when lactation has already ceased.
11429	Galactokinase deficiency is also known as GALK deficiency or Galactosemia type 2. This disorder is marked by the accumulation of galactitol and galactose in the body due to the decreased conversion of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate by the enzyme galactokinase.
11430	Galactorrhea is otherwise known as the spontaneous discharge of milk unrelated to pregnancy or nursing. It is defined by Contemporary Maternal-Newborn Nursing Care as "nipple discharge".
11431	Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency is also known as the first of three types of Galactosemia or otherwise called classic galactosemia. Since galactose is converted through the action of three enzymes, any deficiency in either of these enzymes would lead to galactosemia. Classic galactosemia or galactosemia type 1 is brought about by a deficiency in one of the three enzymes in the Leloir pathway known as Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase or GALT. GALT is responsible for converting galactose into usable glucose in the body.
11432	Galactosemia is a rare congenital metabolic disorder which undermines the affected individual's ability to properly metabolize galactose, one of the sugars found in dairy products. The disorder was first described in 1917 by Goppert, and later fully identified in 1956 by a group led by Herman Kalckar. The incidence ratio of classic type galactosemia is 1 per 47,000 births. Glactosemia is often confused with lactose intolerance. However, galactosemia is a worse condition. Individuals with lactose intolerance have an inherited shortage of the enzyme lactase. These individuals experience abdominal pains after ingesting lactose products but don't have long term effects. In galactosemia, individuals who are afflicted with this disorder tend to have permanent damage to their bodies.
11433	Gall bladder disease is characterized by the infection, inflammation, or obstruction of the gallbladder. Gall bladder disease is also alternatively known as gallbladder attack, biliary disease, or biliary colic.
11434	Gallbladder cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the gallbladder in particular and the biliary tract in general. The gallbladder, along with the bile duct, is responsible for transporting bile. Cancerous gallbladder tumors are called adenocarcinomas, which commonly develop in the inner surface of the gallbladder. These adenocarcinomas are extremely invasive, rapidly penetrating deep into the gallbladder and spreading from the inner surface to the outer surface of the gallbladder. If untreated, the cancer can spread to lymph nodes or travel through the bloodstream and invade other parts of the body.
11435	Galloway Mowat syndrome is a rare genetic disorder found to on autosomal recessive genes. There are many varieties of Galloway Mowat syndrome. It is also known as Hiatal Hernia - Microcephaly - Neprhosis, Galloway Type; Microcephaly-Hiatal Hernia-Nephrosis, Galloway Type; Nephrosis-Microcephaly Syndrome; Nephrosis-Neuronal Dysmigration Syndrome; and Microcephaly-Hiatal Hernia-Nephrotic Syndrome. This disease is characterized by the onset of nephritic syndrome and central nervous system anomalies at an early age.
11436	Gamstorp episodic adynamy is the name taken by Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) when it occurs in humans. Usually, HYPP (known as Impressive Syndrome as well), is a disorder that affects the channels for sodium in the muscle cells, and incapacitates regulation of potassium in the blood. This disorder, with autosomal dominant inheritance, is also a disease that affects horses.
11437	Ganglioglioma, otherwise known as Gangliocytoma, is a disease characterized by the presence of rare tumors. These tumors grow from ganglion cells in the area of the central nervous system, primarily composed of the brain and the spinal cord. Ganglion cells are another way of calling neurons that are found in the brain, some of them found in specific perceptive centers. Mature ganglion cells become clustered with neoplastic glial cells, forming these gangliogliomas.
11438	Known as "bible bump" is a swelling that often appears on or around joints and tendons in the hand or foot. The size of the cyst can change over time, often becoming more inflamed if irritated. It is often located around the wrist and on the fingers.
11439	Complication of necrosis which is the 'cell death' characterized by the decay of body tissues, which become black and malodorous. It caused by infection or ischemia, such as from thrombosis (blocked blood vessel).
11440	Ganser syndrome is a dissociative disorder wherein an individual uncontrollably mimics another person's behavior. Persons with this kind of disorder usually give nonsensical answers to questions. The disease is also called pseudodementia or prison psychosis.
11441	Gardner's syndrome is a disease characterized by the growth of polyps in the colon accompanied by tumors outside the colon. The tumors found in the areas which are away from the colon may range from thyroid cancer, fibromas, sebaceous cysts, osteomas in the skull, and epidermoid cysts. The polyps found within the colon are indicators of the likely progression of the condition to colon cancer.
11442	Gas, or flatulence, is the release of excessive amounts of gas present in the digestive tract. Gastrointestinal gas is made up of swallowed nitrogen and oxygen, as well as methane, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. When gases are unable to be digested, they end up being released as flatus. Flatulence gives of foul smell due to sulfur compounds that were released by the body. Gas in the stomach and intestines may cause abdominal pain and distention.
11443	Gas is created in the digestive tract due to swallowing air and the breaking of foods by bacteria that are found in the colon. Gas is eliminated by burping or passing gas.
11444	These are air bubbles that can get trapped in the stomach and/or passed on to the intestine.
11445	Gastric cancer pertains to cancer of the stomach. Adenocarcinomas, lymphomas, carcinoid tumors, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common types of gastric cancer.
11446	Gastric dumping syndrome, otherwise known as rapid gastric emptying, occurs when the small intestine's lower end, called the jejunum, fills up too fast with undigested food routed from the stomach. Rapid gastric emptying is experienced in two forms: early dumping commences after the meal or during the meal, while late dumping occurs about 1 to 3 hours after the meal. Early dumping is usually linked to difficulty in digesting fats. Late dumping, on the other hand, is associated with difficulty in digesting carbohydrates.
11447	Rapid gastric emptying, also known as dumping syndrome, occurs when undigested food empties too quickly into the small intestine.
11448	Gastric erosion is the inflammation of the stomach lining. It is a minor ulcer in the innermost part of the stomach. When left untreated, it becomes a gastric ulcer.
11449	Primary gastric lymphoma is a rare condition whereby a lymphoma originates from the stomach. This condition accounts for less than 15% of gastric conditions, and only 2% of all lymphomas. However, because of the fact that the stomach is an extremely usual site for lymphomas that originate in other organs that are in metastasis to the stomach, the stomach is one of the most likely sources of the growth of lymphomas in other areas in the gastrointestinal tract. With metastasis, the organ from where the lymphoma originates is not adjacent to the stomach, but nonetheless the disease is spread by travel in the bloodstream (lymphoma is a cancer originating from a type of white blood cells or lymphocytes).
11450	Inflammation of the gastric mucosa of the stomach. Depending on the cause, gastritis may persist acutely or chronically and may coincide with more serious condition such as atrophy of the stomach.
11451	Also known as gastro, gastric flu, and stomach flu. It refers to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, involving both the stomach and the small intestine resulting to acute diarrhea.
11452	Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a condition first documented in 1937 by Kaijser. It manifests as the diffuse eosinophilic infiltration in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, usually with chronic relapses. Any point of the gastrointestinal tract may contract this condition, and how it manifests depends on the extent of the involvement of the bowel wall. Common areas of the GI tract that are affected are the stomach, the small intestine, and the colon.
11453	Gastrointestinal anthrax is a disease formed when the anthrax bacteria attacks the gastrointestinal system. This disrupts the function of the digestive tract leading to stomach poisoning and eventual death.
11454	Gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis is a rare disease caused by fungi. It is characterized by a painless lump underneath the stomach lining, which eventually causes abdominal pain and swelling. It can also cause the development of elephantiasis. The lump that grew on the abdomen may block the lymph nodes causing problems in the bloodstream. The inflammation can be treated by surgical removal of the lump as well as ketoconazole to reduce swelling.
11455	Gastrointestinal bleeding is a form of hemorrhage that occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, reaching from the pharynx down to the rectum. The bleeding can be very life-threatening.
11456	These are rare tumor of the gastrointestinal tract also known 'GIST'. GIST is a form of joint tissue cancer or sarcoma. GISTs are therefore non-epithelial tumors, separate from common forms of bowel cancer.
11457	Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are rare, benign growths in the gastrointestinal tract.
11458	Gastroparesis happens when the muscles in the stomach are not properly functioning which prevents an individual from emptying properly.
11458	Gastroparesis, also known as delayed gastric emptying, is a medical condition consisting of a paresis (partial paralysis) of the stomach ("gastro-"), resulting in food remaining in the stomach for a longer period of time than normal. Normally, the stomach contracts to move food down into the small intestine to digest, while the vagus nerve controls these contractions. Gastroparesis occurs when the vagus nerve is damaged and the muscles of the stomach and intestines do not function normally. Food then moves gradaully or stops moving through the digestive tract.
11459	Gaucher disease is the disease of the lysosome, resulting from the deficiency of the glucocerebrosidase disease resulting in accumulation of its fatty substrate, glucocerebroside. This causes fat to accumulate in the brain, bone marrow, liver, lungs, kidneys, and spleen. People with Gaucher disease are prone to infection. Named after Philippe Gaucher, a French physician who originally described the disease in 1882, the disease is now known to be an autosomal recessive inheritance. Type I is most common (1 in 50,000 births), usually occurring among Ashkenazi Jewish people. Type II manifests beginning 6 months after birth, occurring in 1 in 100,000 live births. Type IIIbegins at any time in life, and occurs in 1 in 100,000 live births.
11460	Gaucher disease is a commonly found lysosomal storage disorder, resulting from the deficiency of the glucocerebrosidase enzyme. The absence of this enzyme allows the collection of fatty material in organs like the brain, bone marrow, kidneys, spleen, lungs, and liver. The disease was originally described by French physician Philippe Gaucher in 1882. Type I, occurring in early life, occurs in 1 in 50, 000 live births and is most common among the Ashkenazi Jews. Type II, occurs in 1 in 100,000 live births, usually begins to manifest after 6 months of birth. Type III can begin at any time in life, and manifests in 1 in 100,000 live births.
11461	Gaucher disease was first described in 1882 by Philippe Gaucher. Today, this is the most common lysosomal storage diseases, resulting in deficiency in glucocerebrosidase. As a result, fatty material settles in the liver, lung, spleen, brain, bone marrow, and kidneys. Type I which occurs in 1 out of 50,000 live births is most common among Ashkenazi Jews and usually manifest early in life or in adulthood. Type II Gaucher disease occurs in 1 out of 100,000 live births manifests after 6 months of age. Type III manifests in 1 out of 100,000 people as well, and occurs at any point in a person's life.
11462	First described in 1882 by French physician Philippe Gaucher, Gaucher disease is one of today's most common lysosomal storage diseases. As a result of the lack of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, fatty materials accumulate in the brain, bone marrow, liver, lung, spleen and the kidneys. This disease is characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance, and as such, is equally likely to affect both male and female individuals.
11463	Geleophysic dwarfism is known by other names, the more popular one being Acromicric dysplasia. This disease that results in a combination of bodily deformities is an extremely rare disorder that is hereditary and inheritable in nature.
11464	Gelineau disease, otherwise called narcolepsy, is a neurological disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness or EDS. The patient may experience disturbed sleep, which might be mistaken for insomnia or other rapid-eye movement (REM) disorders.
11465	Gender identity disorder is a mental illness in which a person shifts from his/her physiological gender identity to that of the opposite sex.
11466	Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is an anxiety disorder that is marked by excessive, uncontrollable and often irrational worry about everyday things, which is disproportionate to the actual source of worry. This excessive worry often interferes with daily functioning, as individuals suffering GAD usually catastrophise, anticipate disaster, and are overly concerned about everyday matters such as health issues, money, family problems, friend problems or work difficulties.
11467	Genetic disorders are genetic anomalies that are usually associated with diseases encoded in the genetic material of cells since the conception of a child. Some forms of these genetic disorders are a result of abnormalities due to errors in cell division, causing either a lack of an X or a Y chromosome, or an excess of one. Klinefelter's syndrome results from a male with 2 X chromosomes, and Down's syndrome results from having an extra chromosome 21. At the moment, some 4,000 genetic disorders have been discovered so far. This is a result of the most genetic disorders being rare, usually present in one in some thousand people. One of the more common genetic diseases is cystic fibrosis, with about 5% of the American population carrying a copy of the gene carrying the disease.
11468	Genital herpes is a highly contagious (STD) sexually transmitted disease.
11469	Genital system cancer is the collective term for cancers that affect the organs in the genital system. Included in this group are vaginal cancer, penis cancer and vulva cancer.
11470	Highly contagious sexually transmitted infection. Genital warts often occur in clusters and can be carry tiny or can spread into large masses in the genital or penis area. For women they occur on the outside and inside of the vagina on the opening (cervix) to the womb (uterus) or around anus.
11471	Genu varum is a physical deformity often called "bow-leggedness" as it manifests as an outward curving of the legs, with great resemblance to a bow. This is characterized by the deformity in both the femur and tibia. It is important to note that if the curvature is only found on the tibia and not on the femur, the deformity is Blount's disease and not Genu varum. All children are bow-legged to some extent at birth. However, over the first year, the knee joints join together and come closer to each other, and the femur begins to slope downward towards the joints. The tibia tends to straighten out as the foot soles face downwards. In the process, the bones ossify. By the time a child is ready to walk; the limbs are already formed and shaped to give the body weight sufficient support.
11472	Genuphonia is an abnormal, persistent and irrational fear of knees or kneeling. Other names are fear or knee, fear of knees, knee fear, knee phobia, knees fear, knees phobia, phobia of knee and or phobia of knees. It is a persistent fear of knees that a person forces himself to avoid.
11473	Geographical tongue results when the layer of small bumps called papillae that cover the tongue are missing. If the papillae are missing, it creates smooth patches of red in the tongue; it can also show an appearance that like a map.
11474	Gastroesophageal reflux disease, known by the moniker GERD, is a disease characterized by damage resulting from an abnormal acid reflux into the esophagal track. This is usually a result of the barrier between the stomach and the esophagus changing.
11475	Gerhardt disease is a rare muscoskeletal condition characterized by intense pain and severe redness of the feet. It is also known as erythromelalgia.
11476	German measles, commonly known as rubella, is a disease caused by Rubella virus.
11477	It is medically known as Rubella. German measles is not the same as measles. German measles is not the same with measles because they are caused by different viruses. It is not contagious nor it is severe that is why it is also called the three-day measles.
11478	German Syndrome is a rare disorder affected by fetal exposure to trimethadione or the anticonvulsant drug which results in different kinds of physical and developmental abnormalities. It is found among infants who were born to epileptic mothers that are being treated with trimethadione for seizures during their pregnancy period. This is also known as Fetal Trimethadione Syndrome.
11479	Germinal mosaicism is a rare autosomal dominant disease in which neither parent has the disease. It is a sporadic genetic disease in which one of the parent gamete cells is defective, but their normal cells are not. Mosaic Downs syndrome is a kind of germinal mosaicism. Parents are advised to undergo genetic counseling to see how the effects of the disease can be reduced.

11610	Cluster headache is a neurological disease characterized by extreme pain. The cyclical pattern of the pain, occurring in periods with spontaneous remissions, gives the disease its name. The "clusters" of frequent attacks can last anywhere from a few weeks to months. During remission periods, the headaches completely stop, although patterns differ from person to person. Remission periods can occur from months to a year. The condition can afflict anyone although it is more common in men and adults aged 20-40 years old. Attacks are classified into episodic or chronic. Episodic attacks are characterized by a higher frequency with longer remissions. Chronic attacks are characterized by frequent headaches that can last up to years.

11631	Heartburn is a painful or burning sensation in the esophagus, just below the breastbone caused by regurgitation of gastric acid.The pain often rises in the chest and may radiate to the neck, throat, or angle of the jaw. Heartburn is also known as one of the causes of chronic cough, and may even mimic asthma. Not considering its name, heartburn actually has nothing to do with the heart. It is because of a burning sensation of the breastbone where the heart is located although some heart problems do have a similar sensation to heartburn.
11632	Heat cramps is the condition where muscles experience numbness and immobility as well as a stinging sensation that lasts for a short period of time.
11633	Heat exhaustion is one of the heat-related syndromes, which vary in severity from mild heat cramps to heat exhaustion to potentially life-threatening heatstroke.

Heparin is administered during cardiovascular surgery.
11675	Hepatic encephlopathy is a neuropsychological disorder causing chronic or acute liver failure. The liver failure results in an accumulation of toxic substances in the blood and would affect the brain cells, which healthy livers normally remove. Impairment of mental functioning is the main characteristic of hepatic encephalopathy.
11676	Hepatic hemangiomas are benign tumors that develop in the liver. They are not cancerous.
11677	Hepatic veno-occlusive disease is a condition in which some of the veins in the liver are blocked. It is sometimes due to a complication of high-dose chemotherapy undergone by a patient prior to a bone marrow transplant.
11678	Hepatitis implies injury to liver marked by presence of inflammatory cells in the liver tissue. The condition can be self limiting, healing on its own, or can progress to scarring of the liver tissue. Hepatitis is acute when it lasts not more than 6 months and chronic when it persists longer.

11684	Hepatitis (plural hepatitides) implies injury to liver marked by presence of inflammatory cells in the liver tissue.
11685	Hepatitis (plural hepatitides) implies injury to liver marked by presence of inflammatory cells in the liver tissue. Another potential viral cause of hepatitis has been identified, known as hepatitis G, and is probably spread by blood and sexual contact. However, there is doubt about whether it causes hepatitis, or is just associated with hepatitis, as it does not appear to replicate primarily in the liver.
11686	Hepatitis (plural hepatitides) implies injury to liver marked by presence of inflammatory cells in the liver tissue. Drug-induced hepatitis (also called toxic hepatitis) appears in eight in every 10,000 people because the liver reacts abnormally during drug exposure, leading to liver damage. This pathology results to the the liver not being able to function properly and the symptoms can begin to be seen.
11687	Hepatitis X or "Lost Hepatitis", is an infectious liver disease usually transmitted via the fecal-oral route. It can be contracted from contaminated food and water.

11690	Hepatoblastoma is a rare malignant liver neoplasm arising in infants and children and composed of tissue resembling fetal or mature liver cells or bile ducts. They are generally present with an abdominal mass. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) commonly is heightened but when AFP is not elevated at diagnosis the prognosis is poor.
11691	Hepatocellular carcinoma is a primary malignancy of the liver. Most cases of HCC are secondary to either a viral hepatitide infection or cirrhosis. In countries where hepatitis is not endemic, most of the malignant cancers in the liver are not primary HCC but metastasis of cancer from elsewhere in the body, like the colon. Treatment options of HCC and prognosis depend on many factors but especially on tumor size and staging.
11692	Hepatocerebral degeneration is an acquired brain defect due to liver damage. When not treated, the disorder can bring about irreversible damages to the whole nervous system.
11693	Hepatolenticular degeneration is an autosomal recessive disease that usually features the presence of copper deposits in organs such as the brain, cornea and liver. It is a result of genetic mutations at the ATP7B gene that encodes copper transporting ATPase 2.

11703	Hereditary deafness-retinitis pigmentosa, also known as Usher syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that features deafness and progressive loss of vision. This condition is due to the impairment of the auditory nerves to send sensory input to the brain. Hereditary deafness-retinitis pigmentosa has three types, and is categorized as an autosomal recessive disorder.
11704	Hereditary elliptocytosis is a blood disorder in which a large proportion of the sufferer's erythrocytes (i.e. red blood cells) are elliptical instead of being biconcave disc-shaped. The disorder comes before haemolytic anaemia.

11708	Hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia is a term used to describe a group of rare, genetically transmitted blood disorders marked by the premature destruction of red blood cells (erythrocytes or RBCs). If the red blood cells cannot be replaced faster than they destroy themselves, anemia results.
11709	Hereditary pancreatitis is a genetic disease affecting the production of enzymes in the pancreas. In the pancreas, a genetic mutation causes the enzyme cationin trypsinogen to be made in a way which leaves it resistant to inactivation through autolysis. Normally this autolysis mechanism prevents trypsinogen from being activated inside the pancreas. However, when the abnormal trypsinogen is activated, it results to a chain reaction where all the trypsinogen in the pancreas is activated, effectively digesting the pancreas from the inside.
11710	Hereditary sensory motor neuropathy is a genetic disorder that leads to nerve damage. Also known as Charcot-Marie Tooth disease, it usually triggers the legs, hands, arms and feet. It also causes reduced sensation, but it is not life-threatening.

11712	Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetically-transmitted form of spherocytosis, an auto-hemolytic anemia marked by the production of red blood cells that are sphere-shaped rather than donut-shaped, and therefore more prone to hemolysis.
11713	Heritable disorders of connective tissue are muscular diseases that cause the connective tissues to degenerate. Connective tissues such as collagen and elastin are important as they link the different organs together, and deterioration of these tissues can lead to muscular problems, weakness and paralysis. Among the kinds of hereditary connective tissue disorders are the Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta, or the brittle bone disease.
11714	Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is an inherited disease which leads to oculocutaneous albinism (decreased pigmentation), bleeding problems due to a platelet abnormality (platelet storage pool defect), and storage of an abnormal fat-protein compound (lysosomal accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin).

11719	Umbilical hernia is a congenital malformation, particularly common in infants of African descent, and more frequent in boys.
11720	The bones (vertebrae) that form the spine in your back are cushioned by small, spongy discs. These discs are healthy, they act as shock absorbers for the spine and maintain the spine flexible.
11721	Herpangina is the name of a painful mouth infection, typically with a fever. Even though the name sounds like herpes, almost all of the many viruses that cause it are coxsackieviruses or other enteroviruses and not herpesvirus.
11722	Infection of the genitals is commonly known as herpes and predominantly occurs following sexual transmission of the type 2 strain of the virus (HSV-2). Oral herpes, colloquially called cold sores, is commonly caused by the type 1 strain of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1).

11724	Herpes of the eye, or dendritic keratitis, is an eye infection caused by the herpes zoster virus.
11725	Herpes simplex is commonly known as as cold sores. It is a viral infection of the skin that arises once or return again and again. This is because when the virus is cleared from the skin by the immune system it hides in the nerves and is never wholly removed from the body. Herpes infections are very prevalent. Unfortunately those who carry the herpes virus can spread the disease without even knowing it.
11726	Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a very serious disorder and one of the most severe viral infections affecting the human central nervous system.
11727	Commonly affecting both men and women, genital herpes is a highly contagious sexually transmitted disease which include itching, pain and sores in your genital area.

HZ oticus manifests as severe otalgia and associated cutaneous vesicular eruption, typically of the external canal and pinna. When linked with facial paralysis, the infection is called Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
11733	Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis includes a wide variety of disease processes that HSV can cause in the human cornea. A variety of clinical manifestations of infectious and immunologic etiologies, such as neurotrophic keratopathy, infectious epithelial keratitis, necrotizing stromal keratitis, immune stromal keratitis (ISK), and endotheliitis, can affect all levels of the cornea. Although more common as a manifestation of recurrent HSV infection, HSV keratitis may also be detected during a primary infection.
11734	Herpetic whitlow is a painful viral infection occurring on the fingers or around the fingernails which is cause by infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is also called digital herpes simplex, hand herpes or finger herpes. These infections are very contagious and are easily spread by direct contact with skin lesions and usually appears as sores or small blisters around the nose, mouth, buttocks, and genitals, though the infections can develop almost anywhere on the skin.
11735	Heterophobia is a term used to describe bias or discrimination against heterosexuals, particularly among homosexual or bisexual people; although, depending on one's views, it is also possible for a heterosexual to be heterophobic.
11736	Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinemia (HHH) syndrome is a very rare inborn error of metabolism; the age at presentation and long-term prognosis vary widely among affected individuals. Growth and developmental delays, periodic confusion and ataxia, and learning disabilities (especially speech delay), are typical presenting symptoms. In this syndrome, a defect in the transport of ornithine into the mitochondrial matrix significantly hinders the urea cycle, thereby impeding nitrogen disposal.
11737	A hiatus hernia or hiatal hernia is the protrusion (or herniation) of the upper part of the stomach into the thorax through a tear or weakness in the diaphragm.
11738	A hiccup (hiccough) is a spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm that typically repeats several times per minute. In medicine, it is referred to as synchronous diaphramatic flutter (SDF).
11739	Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic skin inflammation characterized by the presence of blackheads and one or more red, tender bumps (lesions). The lesions usually enlarge, break open and drain pus. Scarring may occur after several occurrences.
11740	High altitude cerebral edema, also known as "altitude sickness of mountaineers", is a medical condition experienced when traveling to high altitudes. Because of the lack of oxygen in high elevations, some people experience hypoxia, extreme headache and weakness.
11741	High altitude pulmonary edema is another form of altitude sickness this time affecting the lungs. Unlike high altitude cerebral edema, pulmonary edema refers to hypoxia itself, as oxygen can no longer be processed by the lungs.
11742	High Cholesterol is the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood. It is not a disease but a metabolic derangement that can be secondary to many diseases and can contribute many forms of disease, most notably cardiovascular disease. It is nearly related to the terms "hyperlipidemia" (elevated levels of lipids) and "hyperlipoproteinemia" (elevated levels of lipoproteins).
11743	Hip dysplasia is a hereditary disease that, in its more severe form, can eventually lead to crippling lameness and painful arthritis of the joints.

11793	Hydronephrosis is swelling (dilation) of the urine-collecting structures of one or both kidneys because of the obstruction of urine flow from the kidney. This can hinder kidney function. Hydronephrosis is not a specific disease, but a sign of an underlying problem.
11794	Hydrophobia, also known as aquaphobia, is an abnormal and persistent fear of water. Aquaphobia is a specific phobia that concerns a level of fear that is beyond the patient's control or that may interfere with daily life. People may suffer from aquaphobia in a lot of ways and may experience it even though they realize the water in an ocean, a river, or even a bathtub poses no imminent threat. They may avoid such activities as swimming and boating, or they may avoid swimming in the deep ocean despite having mastered basic swimming skills. This anxiety commonly extends to getting wet or splashed with water when it is least expected or being pushed or thrown into a body of water.
11795	Hydrops fetalis is a condition in the fetus marked by an accumulation of fluid, or edema, in at least two fetal compartments, including the subcutaneous tissue, pleura, pericardium, or in the abdomen, which is also known as ascites.

The attacks typically last four to six days, which may be accompanied by other symptoms like abdominal pain, skin rash, and joint pain. The frequency and severity of the attacks vary significantly from one case to another. These episodes can be triggered through physiologic stress, for instance minor trauma or vaccination.
11801	Hypersexuality is the desire to engage in human sexual behavior at a level high enough to be considered clinically significant. Hypersexuality is marked by a debilitating need for frequent genital stimulation which, once achieved, may fail to result in the expected long-term sexual-or emotional-satisfaction. This dissatisfaction is what is believed to encourage the increased frequency of sexual stimulation, as well as additional physiological and neurological symptoms.

The excess bilirubin causes pigmentation or yellowing of the infant's skin and tissues, a condition known as jaundice.
11807	Hypercalcaemia (sometimes spelled Hypercalcemia) is a disorder characterized by elevated levels of calcium in the blood. Hypercalcaemia may be asymptomatic. It can, however, indicate the presence of other diseases; therefore, a diagnosis is needed if it persists.
11808	Literally, Hypercholesterolemia means "high blood cholesterol". Characterized by elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood, Hypercholesterolemia is not a disease per se, but a metabolic dysfunction which may be indicative of other diseases as well as contribute to several other forms of disease. Hypercholesterolemia is strongly correlated with "hyperlipidemia", marked by high lipid levels, and "hyperlipoproteinemia", marked by high lipoprotein levels. A rare genetic form of this disorder is known as familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition occurring in families where members cannot properly metabolize cholesterol.
11809	Hyperchylomicronemia, also known as hyperlipidemia or hyperlipoproteinemia, is characterized by elevated levels of lipids and/or lipoproteins in the blood. This lipid/lipoprotein abnormality, which is common in the general population, poses a high risk of developing into a cardiovascular disease because of the presence of high levels of cholesterol. Some forms of Hyperchylomicronemia may also lead to acute pancreatitis.

The syndrome may affect any part of one's body, but mostly affects the heart, nervous system, and the skin.
11813	Hyperexplexia is an uncommon inherited disorder in which infants show a heightened startle reflex or reaction. The onset of the disease is soon after birth, and is characterized by rigidity or stiffness and supposition of flexed fetal placement. This startle reflex is sometimes joined by 'acute generalized hypertonia' that causes an individual to suddenly fall like a stiff log onto the ground. Other names for this disease include 'startle disease', Kok disease, and stiff baby syndrome.
11814	Hyperglycemia is a condition wherein there's an excessive quantity of glucose circulating in one's blood plasma. It's a grave health dilemma for people with diabetes. Diabetic people having hyperglycemia over a long period of time can cause damage to blood vessels, nerves, and other organs of the body.
11815	Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome or HHNS is a condition where the blood sugar is released through frequent urination. Too much urination leads to dehydration, if one does not drink sufficient fluids. Dehydration may lead to seizures and eventually, death.
11816	Hyperglycinemia (nonketotic) is an innate metabolism error that's distinguished by the build up of huge quantities of amino acid glycine in urine, blood, and especially in the CSF or cerebrospinal fluid. This metabolic block happens in the transformation of glycine into tinier molecules. The disorder comes in several forms: classic form, infantile form, mild-episodic form, late-onset form, and atypical form.
11817	Hyperhidrosis is a common condition in which there is an abnormally excessive and unpredictable sweating. People with this condition can sweat even when temperatures are cool or when they're resting. The sweating may occur in one's hands, armpits, or feet.
11818	Hyperhomocysteinemia is a condition wherein there's an excessive level of homocysteine in the blood. It's often linked with cobalamin or folate deficiency, and genetic defects. Homocysteine is a molecule in the body that's naturally occurring, and is needed in many reactions that happen within body cells. These reactions result to methionine and cysteine formation; if passageways to methionine and cysteine are blocked, then the levels of homocysteine rise.
11819	Hyperinsulinemia is a medical condition in which excess amounts of circulating insulin are found in the blood. This is common among people with diabetes mellitus type 2. It is often linked with metabolic syndrome. The condition is caused by insulin resistance as well as pancreatic cancer. Because of high levels of insulin concentrated in the blood, other organs suffer from inadequate insulin levels resulting to hypoglycemia.
11820	Hyperkalemia is a condition in which there is an excessive level of electrolyte potassium in the blood. Severely high levels of potassium in blood may lead to 'cardiac arrest' and even death. Although mild hyperkalemia may have limited effect on one's heart, moderate condition may produce changes in EKG, and severe cases may cause the suppression of the heart's electrical activity that may cause one's heart to stop beating.

The most common definition also includes difficulties with comprehension of printed material beyond or even at the single-word level. Several hyperlexics also have trouble understanding speech. Probably all children with hyperlexia also lie on the autism spectrum.
11824	Hyperlipidemia is a condition in which abnormal levels of lipids are found in the blood. Lipids, or fatty molecules, take part in the body's metabolism process and abnormalities may affect different body functions. High levels of lipids may induce organ problems such as cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis and acute pancreatitis. Proper diet and statin therapies are performed to control the production of lipids in the blood.
11825	Hypermagnesemia is a kind of electrolyte condition in which there is a disturbing high level of magnesium found in the blood. This a rare condition since one of the kidney's main function is to excrete excess amounts of magnesium in the body.

11830	Hyperoxaluria is a condition in which there is emission of excessive quantity of 'oxalate' in one's urine. Oxalate is basically organic salt that forms soluble salt when combined with potassium and sodium, but when joint with calcium, it generates insoluble product that's found in kidney stones. Mild types of the condition are comparatively common, and may cause the formation of kidney stones. Bigger quantities of the oxalate in urine may be due to intestinal diseases that cause over-absorption of the oxalate.
11831	Hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by an over activity of the parathyroid glands, often caused by an overproduction of the parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH regulates and helps maintain the levels of calcium and phosphate in the body. When one or more of the parathyroid glands becomes over-active, calcium levels are elevated while phosphate levels drop.
11832	The darkening of the skin in an area of prior injury or skin disorder from increased pigment (melanin) left from the healing process is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. When old red blood cells die, the darkening may sometimes be also due to an iron pigment left behind.

11837	Hypersexuality is the desire to engage in human sexual behavior at a level high enough to be considered clinically significant. Hypersexuality is marked by a debilitating need for frequent genital stimulation which, once achieved, may fail to result in the expected long-term sexual-or emotional-satisfaction. This dissatisfaction is what is believed to encourage the increased frequency of sexual stimulation, as well as additional physiological and neurological symptoms.

11851	Hypoadrenalism is a condition whereaby the adrenal glands are underactive, with suppressed ability to produce a range of hormones. The adrenal glands, located above each kidney, are responsible for hormone production. The inactivity of these glands is called hypoadrenalism.
11852	Hypoaldosteronism is a condition characterized by reduced levels of the hormone aldosterone. This condition may lead to a potentially serious disease called hyperkalemia. It can also led to hyponatremia.
11853	Hypocalcemia is a type of electrolyte disturbance characterized by a having low serum calcium levels. The human body regulates only the calcium that are not bound to proteins or ionized. Individuals with abnormally low levels of blood proteins may have plasma calcium that are inaccurate. In cases like this, the ionized calcium level is considered more accurate.
11854	Hypochondria sometimes referred to as health phobia) refers to an excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness. Usually, hypochondria persists even after a physician has evaluated a person and reassured him/her that his/her concerns about symptoms do not have an underlying medical basis or, if there is a medical illness, the concerns are far in excess of what is appropriate for the level of disease
11855	Hypochondriasis is a psychiatric illness in which a person takes on anxiety attacks regarding his present health condition. This condition is traditionally known as hypochondria.

Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant varieties of the disease exist. The disease comes in one to five forms, perinatal, infantile, childhood, adult, and odontohypophosphatasia.
11872	The loss of skin color (pigmentation) after your skin heals from an injury is called post-inflammatory hypopigmentation because pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) are damaged or destroyed in the healing process.
11873	Hypopituitarism is a disorder characterized by a deficiency in one or several hormones of the pituitary gland. Hormones are produced by the hypothalamus to regulate secretions from the pituitary gland. This is why a dysfunction in the hypothalamus often causes disorders in the pituitary gland.
11874	Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, HLHS for short, is a condition characterized by severe malformation and underdevelopment of the left part of the heart. Individuals with HLHS experiences poor blood circulation since the right side of the heart compensates for the inefficiency of the left side.

11913	Inborn errors of metabolism are made up of a large class of genetic diseases involving disorders of metabolism. The majority are due to defects of single genes that code for enzymes that facilitate conversion of various substances into others (products). In most of the disorders, problems occur due to accumulation of substances which are toxic or interfere with normal function, or to the effects of reduced ability to synthesize essential compounds. Inborn errors of metabolism are now often called congenital metabolic diseases or inherited metabolic diseases, and these terms are considered synonymous.

Due to some thorax malformations, patients suffering from Jarcho-Levin syndrome are at a higher risk for life-threatening pulmonary complications. It is also described as short trunk dwarfism with abnormalities in the thorax causing thoracic insufficiency. The vertebrate are fused, preventing the rib cage from developing properly, consequently the chest cavity becomes too small to be big enough for the growing lungs.
11978	Jaundice is the yellowish staining of the skin and sclerae (the whites of the eyes) that is caused by high levels in blood of the chemical bilirubin. The color of the skin and sclerae is depending on the level of bilirubin. When the bilirubin level is slowly elevated, they are yellowish. When the bilirubin level is high, it tends to be brown.
11979	Jaundice in newborns is a condition where increased bile pigment causes yellowish skin and eyes. This is due to a congenital damage in the red blood cells. Infants suffering from this condition may be because of a prenatal mismatch between the Rh factor in their blood and that of their mothers. Jaundice can also be brought about by a temporary enzymatic defect called hyperbilirubinemia.

This disorder can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. HIE has changing expressivity and is linked with several other abnormalities. The general findings are recurring abscesses of the skin (this is why it is called the Job syndrome, derived from the biblical character Job); high IgE serum levels; pneumonia which comes with pneumatocele development; and dental, facial or skeletal defects. Most cases of this disorder are sporadic but there are cases of multiplex families who display autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance. Autosomal recessive individuals usually have acute molluscum contagiosm. Also, it is possible for neurological complications to develop because of other viral infections. The patients also lack dental or skeletal involvement and they do not develop cysts of the lungs. A few authorities have the belief that 2 separate syndromes are in existence, not just one.
11983	Jock itch, also known as tinea cruris, is a fungal infection of the skin in the groin. The warm, moist environment is the best place for the fungus to grow.
11984	The Johnson Munson syndrome or aphalangy, urogenital-intestinal and hemivertibrae dysgenesis is a very rare syndrome which has been observed in only three siblings. It is associated with aplisia of the phalanges of the feet and hands or hypoplasia; hermivertibrea, and several other intestinal and/or urogenital defects. Intrafamiliar variability is highly important as one of the three siblings (a sister) had fatal defects (pulmonary hypoplasia and Potter syndrome). The other brother who was also sick with the syndrome was in great health and he had a normal development of his psychomotor skills at the sixth month of age.
11985	Joseph disease, also known in names such as the Machado-Joseph disease and spinocerebral ataxia type 3, is a rare disorder characterized by lack of muscle control.
11986	Joubert syndrome is a genetic disorder that is very rare. This disorder affects the brain areas which control coordination and balance. It was first identified by a pediatric neurologist named Marie Joubert from Montreal in Canada. The physician was then working with McGill Neurological Institute.
11987	A part of every human's instinct of survival includes sudden reaction to unexpected stimulus. Often, the reaction is a startle which is a reflexive movement to get away from the stimulus. This reaction also causes change of blood pressure and respiration. Among normal people, this could only last for seconds but for those who suffer from Jumping Frenchmen of Maine disorder, the result could be very interesting (and in some cases, shocking). Jumping Frenchmen of Maine is a very rare disease which was originally described in 1878 by a certain George Miller Beard.
11988	Juvenile dermatomyositis or JDM is an autoimmune disorder which causes vasculitis manifesting itself among children; and it is a pediatric equivalent of dermatomyositis. JDM manifests vasculitis an inflammation which is caused by the attack of the body's immune system to the blood vessels. In the US, the rate of occurrence of JDM is estimated to be 3 in every 1,000,000 children annually. This is about 300 to 500 fresh cases every year or about 3,000 to 5,000 children. Other types of juvenile myositis include juvenile inclusion-body myositis (JIBM) and juvenile polymyositis (JPM). These two other types are very rare and are not that as common among children. The underlying cause of Juvenile dermatomyositis is still unknown. It is most probable that it has a genetic component such as other autoimmune diseases (inherited within the family). The most common triggering factors include infections, immunizations, sunburn and injuries.
11989	Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy or JME is also called the Janz syndrome. This is a common type of idiopathic generalized epilepsy which represents 5-10% of all the types of epilepsies. This disease manifests primarily between the 12th-18th month and with myoclonus showing very early during the morning. Most of the patients also manifest absence and tonic-clonic seizures. Studies have shown at least six loci for JME of which 4 have specific causative genes. Most of the genes are ion channels together with the sole non-ion channel gene after manifesting effects on currents of ion channel.
11990	A name given to a skin problem on the feet of children and may occasionally develop similar signs to the hands is called juvenile plantar dermatosis. Tending to gradually improve, it is seen most often in boys aged four to eight. Juvenile plantar dermatosis is also called sweaty sock syndrome where the sole of the forefoot becomes shiny and glazed. The top of the toes and other parts other parts of the feet may also be affected while toewebs are spared and the skin becomes scaly. Taking many weeks to heal, painful cracks (fissures) develop under the toes and on the ball of the foot. Sweaty sock syndrome is usually severe during the summer months.
11991	JRA or Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is not just a single illness. It is, in fact, a group of illnesses of unidentified etiology. The manifestation is a chronic inflammation of the joint. Treatment advances in the last thirty years have altered the prognosis for the more acute types of this disease. The first treatment is limited with only the use of salicylates and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs. The initial treatment resulted into numerous patients being bound to their wheelchairs. Some patients tried synovectomies to get rid of tissue excesses which result from uncontrolled arthritis. The second-line medicines that were added have improved the prognosis for those who suffered from JRA. It started with gold salt injection and gradually replaced by MTX or methotrexate which is a more effective solution. These drugs are administered with team approach background in centers of pediatric rheumatology. In there, occupational and physical therapies have allowed much improved physical functions. The introduction of etanercept (which is a biologic enemy of tumor necrosis factor or TNF) has introduced a new era in treatments. A few more biologic agents such as the anakinra (which is an IL-1 or interleukin-1 receptor opponent) could be used in some patients who are not responsive to second-line medication. The future holds an inhibition of IL-6 which could be effective in systemic sufferers with JRA with high levels.
11992	Schizophrenia is one of the most complex of all psychological health disorders. It is a severe, chronic, and disabling disturbance of the brain that leads to distorted thinking, strange feelings, and unusual behavior and use of language and words.
11993	Kabuki syndrome also called as Kabuki makeup syndrome (KMS) or Niikawa Kuroki syndrome in the past, is a rare pediatric inborn disease. This congenital disorder has no known cause and comes with numerous inborn anomalies and retardation of mental development. It was discovered by Niikawa and Kuroki who were Japanese scientists. It was named Kabuki syndrome because the individuals who are affected by this illness look like Kabuki dolls or Kabuki performers who are wearing white makeup. The name term Niikawa-Kuroki syndrome, obviously, relates to the two scientists who made the discovery of the illness.
11994	Kallman syndrome, by itself, is a type of hypogonadism (which is a decrease in the function of the sex glands that produce hormones). This is caused by a lack of GnRH hormone (the one that releases gonadotropin). The term Spastic paraplegia with Kallman syndrome has not been discussed in the previous years. This is a very rare genetic disease which is characterized chiefly by lower leg weakness and mild spasticity. Other signs include lack of production of the sex hormones and also the inability to smell odors.
11995	Kaolin is processed by, first, removing it from seams that are underground in an area of mining. The process involves slicing, drying, and pulverizing to make a finished product. A study was done to know the concentration of kaolin dust in different areas of work. The study was also set up to be able to assess the occurrence of pulmonary and radiographic function defects among workers. There were 65 subjects from the Georgia kaolin mines. It was noted that the respirable concentrations of kaolin dust were at their peak in the areas where the product was being processed as compared to the mine or areas of maintenance. The study ran through 1977 until 1981. The kaolin dust level that is was respirable in the processing are in the year 1981 was at 1.74 milligrams/m3 and 0.14 milligrams/m3 in the area of mining. 5 of the workers from the processing area had evidences, confirmed by radiography, of kaolin pneumoconiosis. The FVC or the forced vital capacity and FEV1 mean values for the entire group were observed to be in the normal range. When the spirometric quantities were stated as a percentage or portion of the values that were predicted, the FEV1 and FVC were noticeably lower among workers with kaolinosis than among workers from within the processing area. Both the FEV1 and the FVC have declined considerably as the years progress and the worker remains working in the processing area. The FEV1/FVC%, on the other hand, was not changed significantly by either the kaolinosis presence or by the increase in work years. This indicates that the defect was confined and thus very likely to be a result of inhalation of the kaolin dust as compared to smoking.
11996	Moritz Kaposi, a Hungarian dermatologist was the first one to describe Kaposi's sarcoma, as a tumor caused by Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV8). HHV8 is the eight human herpes virus. Kaposi's sarcoma is the cancer that usually comes about in many AIDS suffering patients.
11997	Karsch Neugebauer syndrome (Ectrodactyly) also known as "lobster claw syndrome", is a rare congenital (present at birth) deformity of the hand. This deformity is characterized by webbing of the fingers or toes. This unusual placement or position presents the hand to look like the claws of a lobster. This disorder also exhibits a missing toe or a missing finger. Other names that this disorder goes by are split hand deformity, lobster claw hand, cleft hand, ectrodactilia of the hand, and split hand/foot malformation.
11998	Kartagener syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder, which causes the cilia (tiny, hair-like structures) to be faulty or defective; thus prevent it from functioning properly. The cilia line the respiratory tract and fallopian tubes. It acts as the sweeper by brushing off all inhaled particles of dust, smoke, and other microbes out of the respiratory tract. Essentially, if the cilia are not functioning well, mucus and other inhaled germs will remain in the lungs, allowing the development of recurring infections in the lungs.
11999	Kaufman Oculocerebrofacial syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder. This rare genetic medical condition is characterized by some abnormal looking facial features including small head, narrow face, eye anomalies, small mandible, upslanting palpebral fissure (the distance between the upper and lower eyelids), highly arched palates, and preauricular skin tags. Severely inflicted people show very obvious facial features of a mentally retarded person.
12000	Kawasaki Syndrome is a medical condition with unknown cause that results in inflammation of the walls of the blood vessels (vasculitis) and primarily affects young children.
12001	Kearns-Sayre syndrome is a neuromuscular disorder of a genetic origin. However, it is different from other mitochondrial disorders because it occurs periodically and not maternally inherited. Onset of the disorder usually occurs before the person reaches the age of 20.
12002	Keloids are type of scars characterized by significant marks of skin elevation; it is an overgrowth of tissue on the exact location of the healed skin injury. Keloids usually occur after an injury or surgery. Keloids are usually firm, fibrous lesions. Keloids are non-contagious and non-malignant at the same time. Not like scars, keloids do not sink in size. Keloids often form on the back, chest, earlobes, and shoulder. The face is not primarily at a risk of developing keloids.
12003	Kennedy disease is a rare hereditary disease affecting the nerves and muscles (neuromuscular). Females can be carriers of the disease but only males present the symptoms of the disease. Kennedy Disease is also known as X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
12004	Keratitis is the scarring of the cornea of they eye. This scarring can cause severe infections that may lead to vision loss or blindness. A common kind of this condition is dendric keratitis; it is a scarring brought about by herpes zoster infections. The disease can be treated with idoxuridine as well as vidarabine.
12005	Keratoacanthoma is a fairly common, epithelial tumor. Formerly, it was regarded as variant of Squamous Cell Carcinoma; a form of malignant cancer that occur in many different organs of the body including the skin, lips, esophagus, and mouth among other else. It is a disease common in the elderly. Keratoacanthoma usually disappears by itself within a period of time; it is non-contagious.
12006	Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca is an eye condition commonly known as, "dry eyes". It is characterized by decreased in tear production and involves inflammation of the conjunctiva. In the common language, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca means dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea. Other names for this disorder includes: xerophthmalia, dry eye syndrome, Sicca syndrome, keratitis Sicca.
12007	A rare degenerative disorder marked by a progressive thinning and cone-shape appearance of the cornea of the eyes; it is categorized as a non-inflammatory eye ailment. It is considered as the most usual type of corneal dystrophy in the US.

12010	Keratosis Pilaris is a common skin condition that is limited to hair follicles. It is characterized by the development of uneven lumps in the skin. Its appearance resembles the skin of the chicken; precisely the reason why many refer to it as "chicken skin." Presence of these bumps are usually predominant on the back, upper arms (outer side), and other body surfaces (except the soles of feet and palms). It is always mistaken to be acne when present in the face. Keratosis Pilaris is not a serious medical condition and has no capacity to bring about serious health conditions.
12011	Seborrheic Keratosis is a benign skin growth that can occur during puberty but are more common in older people starting at the age of 40. Seborrheic Keratosis is often illustrated as to having a "pasted-on" appearance because growth only involves the top layer of the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis). It is also described as a thickening condition of the skin that increases with age.`
12012	A scalp condition that occurs in severe cases of scalp ringworm (tinea capitis), appearing as an inflamed, thickened, pus-filled area, and it is sometimes accompanied by a fever is called kerion. Commonly seen in children, the underlying condition, scalp ringworm is a usually harmless fungal infection of the hair and scalp that occurs as scaly spots and patches of broken hair on the head.
12013	Kernicterus is a rare medical condition associated with high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin build up in the brain can cause serious brain damage and other neurological problems.

12016	Kidney failure is a condition in which the kidneys no longer respond to treatment resulting to the death of the organs. it is a result of different diseases that affect the kidneys.
12017	Acute kidney failure is the sudden loss of the kidneys' ability to perform their main function - eliminate excess fluid and electrolytes as well as waste material from the blood. When the kidneys lose their filtering ability, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and waste accumulate in the body.
12018	Kidney infection (pyelonephritis) is a specific type of urinary tract infection (UTI) that generally begins in your urethra or bladder and travels up into your kidneys. Kidney infection, or pyelonephritis, very often results when a bacterial infection moves from the lower urinary tract like bladder, urethra to the kidneys.

12023	Kleine-Levin Syndrome is a rare disease identified by periods of too much, unnecessary sleepiness that can reach to 20 hours of sleep; excessive food intake (compulsive hyperphagia); hypersexuality or abnormally uncontrolled sexual drive. This rare disorder is more probable to occur in males in their puberty rather than females.
12024	Kleptomania is an inability or great difficulty in resisting impulses of stealing. Kleptomania is recognized from shoplifting or ordinary theft, as shoplifters and thieves generally steal for monetary value, or associated gains and usually display intent or premeditation, while people with kleptomania are not necessarily contemplating the value of the items they steal or even the theft until they are compelled.
12025	Klinefelter's syndrome is a rare chromosomal genetic syndrome characterized by having XXY chromosomes instead of XX or XY chromosomes. Sufferers of this syndrome are usually males because of the presence of Y chromosomes. This syndrome is considered as the second most common extra chromosome condition.

12029	Kluver-Bucy syndrome is a kind of disorder that develops when the right and left medial temporal lobes start to malfunction. People with this disease show lesions in the temporal lobes; they also exhibit socially inadequate licking or touching behaviors, bulimia, memory problems, hypersexuality and placidity, as well as the inability to recognize faces and objects. This disorder rarely develops in humans.

This usually occurs when a weaned children receives a diet replacement that high on carbohydrates and starch but low in protein.
12042	Kyasanur forest disease is a viral hemorrhagic fever that is usually transmitted by ticks (tick-borne). Like all tick-borne diseases, Kyasanur forest disease is caused by infection by a virus. In this case, the virus belongs to the flaviviridae family of virus. This virus mostly spread through arthropod vectors. This disease is prevalent in South Asia. This disease is also known as Monkey Disease and was reported from the Kyasanur Forest of Karnataka, India.
12043	Kyphosis is commonly described as curvature of the upper spine. The medical condition can be due to bad posture or any structural abnormality in the spine. There are several kinds of Kyphosis: Postural Kyphosis, Nutritional Kyphosis, Congenital Kyphosis, and Scheuermann's Kyphosis.

12048	Lactic acidosis is a condition formed by the excess amounts of lactic acid in the body. This buildup causes loss of balance and coordination, shortness of breath and may lead to other complications such as diabetes and liver disease. Among the symptoms of lactic acidosis are rapid breathing and abdominal pain. Lactic acidosis may occur due to IV infections as well as dysfunctional mitochondrial functions.
12049	Lactose intolerance, also called lactase deficiency, means you aren't able to fully digest the milk sugar (lactose) in dairy products. It is not usually dangerous, but symptoms of lactose intolerance can be uncomfortable enough to steer you clear of the dairy aisles.

These inclusion bodies are known as Lafora bodies. Lafora Disease is name after a Spanish neuropathologist, Gonzalo Rodriguez Lafora.
12051	Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that involves the neuromuscular junction. It has a great similarity with Myasthenia Gravis, but there are also obvious distinctions with the symptoms and pathogenetic features between the two medical conditions. The disease is common in middle aged and older people; however, this is not a guarantee that young people will have no chances of suffering the disease.
12052	Lamellar Ichthyosis is a rare inherited skin disorder. An infant born with this disorder is covered with a translucent membrane; after the membrane is cast off, it will reveal different sizes of red scaly skin patches.
12053	Landau-Kleffner syndrome is a rare, childhood neurological syndrome marked by the abrupt or slowly development of inability to understand or express language (aphasia) and an abnormal electroencephalogram or EEG. This is because the syndrome affects the part of the brain that is responsible for comprehension and speech control. Usually, this syndrome affects children aged 5 to 7 years old. This syndrome is also known as: infantile acquired aphasia, aphasia with convulsive disorder, and acquired epileptic aphasia.
12054	Landouzy-Dejerine muscular dystrophy, also known as Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is an autosomal dominant form of muscle weakness disorder. On the initial onset of this disorder, the first affected part is the facial, scapulo and humeral skeletal muscles. Landouzy-Dejerine muscular dystrophy is the third most prevalent genetic disease affecting the skeletal muscle.
12055	Langer-Giedion syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder that occurs when a chrosomal material is deleted. This syndrome is also known as trichorhinophalangeal syndrome or LGCR (for Langer-Giedion Chromosome Region). This medical condition is named after the two doctors dig into research about this condition during the 1960s.
12056	Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a medical condition characterized with the increased production of Langerhans cell. Langerhans cell are abnormal cells originating from the bone marrow and have the capability to drift from the skin to the lymph nodes. Langerhans cell histiocytosis was formerly referred to as histiocytosis X. The Histiocyte society renamed the disease in 1985.
12057	Laparoschisis, also known as gastroschisis is a medical condition characterized by an abnormal opening in the abdomen causing some of the abdominal contents to develop outside the fetal abdomen. Laparoschisis is also known by other medical names: abdominoschisis and paraomphalocele. This occurrence happens more on male infants compared to incidents reported on female infants.
12058	Laron-type dwarfism also known as Laron syndrome, is a autosomal recessive disorder; where the body has adequate amounts of growth hormones but is deficient with receptors needed to develop the growth hormones resulting to excessively short stature or dwarfism. Laron-type dwarfism is named after the Israeli researcher Zvi Laron, who reported the medical condition in 1966 after a longstanding observation that started in 1958.
12059	Larsen syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease. It is a rare connective tissue disorder. This medical condition is very rare with the incidence occurring only 1 in every 100,000 people. Larsen syndrome was named after L.J.

12060	Laryngeal cancer is the cancer of the larynx. It often results to permanent loss of voice or degeneration of the larynx.
12061	Laryngeal carcinoma is cancer of the laryngeal area. It is also referred to as cancer of the larynx or laryngeal cancer. Usually, laryngeal carcinomas are squamous cell carcinomas that come from the squamous cells that form a large part of the laryngeal cavity.
12062	Laryngeal Papillomatosis is a rare medical condition characterized by the development of tumors in the larynx, vocal chords, or respiratory tract. This medical condition is caused and triggered by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection in the throat. In due course, these tumors will cause blockage to the airway passage, which may result to breathing problems.
12063	Laryngitis is the medical term for inflammation and swelling of the larynx, which is also known as the voice box. A lot of the causes of laryngitis, such as common viruses or using your voice too much, are not serious. there are few causes, however, require medical attention.
12064	Laryngocele is a rare medical condition where an air-filled sac connected with the larynx becomes enlarged. It can be of congenital nature. It can also be acquired. Players of wind instruments are probable victims of this rare disorder because of continuous strong expiration, which gives weighty pressure in the larynx, which later on leads to laryngeal ventricle dilatation. There external and internal type of Laryngocele and there is also a combination of both.
12065	Laryngomalacia is a medical condition wherein the larynx is extremely soft enough to cause breathing difficulties and also can initiate voice quality negative effects. Because the larynx is very soft, it tends to collapse during inhalation causing blockage to the airway passage. Laryngomalacia is literally referred to as soft larynx. The condition is most common to occur in infants; however, it can also occur in older patients essentially those who have neuromuscular problems that are possible to develop weakness of the throat muscles.
12066	Larynx cancer, or laryngeal cancer, is a grave condition in which the larynx is ruined due to growths and infections. This can lead to loss of one's voice.
12067	Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever named after the town in Lassa, Nigeria. The disease was first described in 1969 and is widespread in West African nations.
12068	Latent tuberculosis is a form of tuberculosis in which the actual disease is not actively felt by the patient. This form of tuberculosis is not contagious, but it is still caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The disease is diagnosed be special tests such as Mantoux test, Heaf test and Tine test, and is treated by the same procedure as the typical tuberculosis.
12069	Lateral epicondylitis is commonly called tennis elbow where the outer part of the elbow becomes painful and tender. Based from the available scientific evidence, tennis elbow is an idiopathic, self-limiting, enthesopathy, of middle age. A lot of other hand and arm conditions, speculative etiologies such as overuse, tennis, etc. has limited scientific support and likely overstated.
12070	The protein in rubber can cause an allergic reaction in some people. The thin, stretchy latex rubber in gloves, condoms and balloons is high in protein. It causes a lot of allergic reactions than products made of hard rubber (like tires). And also, because some latex gloves are coated with cornstarch powder, the latex protein particles stick to the cornstarch and fly into the air when the gloves are taken off.

MVP, in its nonclassis form, carries a low risk of complications. Severe cases of MVP though may include complications such as infective endocarditis, regurgitation and in rare circumstances, cardiac arrest that usually results to sudden death. The term for the disease was coined by J. Michael Criley in 1966. It gained acceptance over JB Barlow's "billowing" of the mitral valve description. MVP has different subtypes namely classic, nonclassic, symmetric, asymmetric, flail or non-flail. The subtypes are based on the leaflet thickness, convacity and type of connection to the mitral annulus.

They may occur as new lesions or as a change in an existing mole and may be single or multiple. With the risk increasing with the number of atypical moles present, people with atypical moles may be at increased risk for developing skin cancer (melanoma).
12364	Moles otherwise known as Nevi, are clusters of pigmented cells that is usually small, and dark brown in color spots. It is usually not harmless but in some cases they are cancerous.

These diseases include gonorrhea, HIV, herpes virus infection, and hepatitis B and C.
12384	Motion sickness (also known as car sickness, sea sickness, air sickness) occurs when two "motion messages" to the brain conflict. One "motion message" comes from the inner ear that controls balance and another "motion message" is from the eyes. During this changes in position caused by travel, these two "motion messages" conflict thereby causing motion sickness.
12385	MND or motor neurone diseases are a group of progressive neurological disorders that destroy the cells that control voluntary muscle activity such as speaking, walking, breathing, and swallowing.

This condition can be found in Mexico, the Sahel, in pan-Arabia, Brazil and in the semi-arid areas within India. Mycetoma can also exist in countries as distant as Romania. Mycetoma consists of two common forms. These are the bacterial mycetoma which is also referred to as actinomycetoma and the fungal mycetoma or also known as eumycetoma. These two common presentations of this condition are very hard to determine and differentiate from each another even under the electron microscopy.

12437	Mycoplasma pneumoniae (shortened as M. pneumoniae) pertains to a tiny bacterium belonging to the class Mollicutes. In general, Mollicutes lack a peptidoglycan cell wall, and instead have a cell membrane that contains sterol compounds similar to eukaryotic cells. These sterols are obtained from the host sterum, allowing the organism to retain its simple structure. Because of the absence of a cell wall, these organisms are therefore resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics, which work by destroying the bacterial cell wall.
12438	Mycoplasmal pneumonia is a bacterial infection caused by a very small bacterium, in the class Mollicutes. Characteristically, these organisms are resistant to penicillin as well as in other beta-lactam antibiotics. The bacteria closely associated with this condition spread via transmission of respiratory droplets. When the bacteria get attached to the mucosa of a host organism, it will extract nutrients to grow. Its reproduction is by binary fission. The sites where it can commonly get attached include the upper and lower respiratory tract which results to bronchitis, pharyngitis and pneumonia. Atypical Pneumonia refers to the infection caused by this very small bacterium primarily due to its protracted course. Moreover, it is characterized by lack of sputum production and by multiple extra-pulmonary symptoms. Chronic mycoplasma infections had also been associated with rheumatoid arthritis. The severity of illnesses from mycoplasma is often defined as mild to moderate.
12439	Mycosis Fungoides is also referred to as Alibert-Bazin Syndrome or granuloma fungoides. It is the most common presentation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma wherein the skin is the primary part of the body that is affected. As the disease progresses, it can also affect the internal organs and the blood. This condition was initially described in 1806 by a French dermatologist named, Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert. Mycosis fungoides caused several misconceptions because it stands for a fungal disease characterized by a mushroom-like presentation. It was named as such by Alibert based upon his description of the disease's severe case which appears similarly to a mushroom. However, it is far from a fungal disease or infection. It is actually a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
12440	Mycosis Fungoides Lymphoma is classified as the most common presentation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In general, the skin is the primary part of the body that is affected. However, it can advance internally as the disease progresses. Initially described in 1806 by a French dermatologist named, Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert, mycosis fungoides lymphoma caused some misconceptions. It stands for a fungal disease characterized by a mushroom-like presentation. It was named as such by Alibert based upon his description of the disease's severe case which appears similarly to a mushroom. However, it is far from a fungal disease or infection. It is actually a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

It is presented with varying chances of transforming into acute myelogenous leukemia. In majority of cases, this condition is also associated with severe anemia that requires regular blood transfusion.
12443	Myelodysplastic Syndromes or MDS was previously known as Preleukemia. It is characterized by a diverse group of hematological conditions. This hematological disease is associated with ineffective blood cell production. It is presented with varying chances of transforming into acute myelogenous leukemia. In majority of cases, this condition is also associated with severe anemia that requires regular blood transfusion.
12444	Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia is also referred to as Agnogenic Myeloid Metaplasia, Chronic Idiopathic Myelofibrosis, and Primary Myelofibrosis. This condition was initially described in 1879. At present, it is classified as myeloproliferative disease resulting from the growth and proliferation of an abnormal bone marrow stem cell. This is due to the bone marrow being replaced with fibrous connective tissue. Assmann's Disease or Heuck-Assmann Disease is an eponym for this condition. Mean survival for patients with this condition is 5 years. Usual causes of mortality are bleeding, infection, portal hypertension, organ failure and resulting leukemia.

Myeloma is regarded as incurable, but remissions could be induced with steroids, chemotherapy, thalidomide and stem cell transplants. Myeloma is a part of the broad group of diseases called hematological malignancies.
12446	Myelomeningocele otherwise known as the Spina Bifida is a birth defect that is often called the neural tube defect which is caused whenever the tissue found in the spinal cord of a fetus does not close orderly resulting in to a defect in the spinal cord and the backbone of the infant.
12447	Myeloperoxidase deficiency is considered a common genetic disorder which is characterized by a deficiency in the quantity of enzyme myeloperoxidase or its lack of functionality in the human body. This enzyme can usually be found in some types of phagocytic immune cells, the polymorphonuclear leukocytes in particular. Myeloperoxidase deficiency typically has no distinct signs of immunodeficiency among majority of affected patients. This is despite its immune deficiency presentation which is especially observed in candida albicans infections. Basically, this condition shows no specific manifestations of an immunodeficiency. The absence of major symptoms for Myeloperoxidase deficiency suggest that the role of the enzyme myeloperoxidase in immune responses might be similar with that of other mechanisms of intracellular killing of bacteria that had been phagocytosed.
12448	Myiasis is a disease affecting both animals and humans resulting from parasitic dipterous fly larvae which is feeding on the host's living or necrotic tissues. Other colloquial terms used for the disease Myiasis are fly-strike and fly blown. Fritz Zumpt, a German entomologist described this disease as "the infestation of live human and vertebrate animals with dipterous larvae, which at least for a period, feed on the host's dead of living tissue, liquid body substances, or ingested food."
12449	Myoadenylate Deaminase Deficiency or MADD is classified as a metabolic disorder with a recessive genetic cause. This condition affects about 1-2% of the Eastern descent populations which makes it not particularly a rare disease. MADD is somewhat rarer in the Oriental populations. Myoadenylate Deaminase which is also referred to as AMP deaminase is an enzyme responsible in converting adenosine monophosphate or AMP into inosine monophosphate or IMP. This process frees ammonia molecule. This is a portion of metabolic process responsible in converting sugar, fat and protein to cellular energy. A cell usually converts sugar, fat and protein to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the mitochondria to utilize energy. Processes within the cell, the muscles in particular then convert ATP to adenosine diphosphate or ADP which frees the energy to perform work. Failure to deaminate AMP molecules covers three major effects which are: 1. The cell and body loses considerable amounts of AMP 2. Ammonia is not freed or released in the event that the cell performs work 3. Maintenance of IMP levels within the cell is impaired

12466	Myotubular Myopathy (MTM) is the most common form of a group of congenital myopathies called centronuclear myopathies (CNM). CNM is characterized by the abnormal positioning of the nuclei in the skeletal muscle cells. Normally, the nuclei are located at the periphery. But in CNM patients, they are located centrally, i.e. in the center of the cell. The term myotubular myopathy was first coined by a New York neurologist named Dr. Spiro. Dr. The presence of nuclei in the center of the cells reminded Dr. Spiro of the "myotubular" stage during embryonic development, thus the term. He suspected that the myopathy may be caused by growth detention during the myotubular phase.

It is located in the area of the neck and head 15% of the time occurring in about 1% of infants in the United States. Its appearance is similar to those of acquired one but is usually larger in diameter and may have excess hair, called hypertrichosis. Congenital melanocytic nevus microscopically appears similar to acquired nevi with two notable exceptions. The neval cells are found deeper into the dermis for congenital virus, and the deeper neval cells are found along with neurovascular bundles with surrounding sebaceous glands, hair follicles and subcutaneous fat.
12543	Nezelof syndrome is also a form of thymic dysplasia. This condition is due to a congenital immunodeficiency meaning it is already present at birth. Underdevelopment of the thymus is the major finding among patients. It is also the primary cause of this disease. This condition is an immune deficiency disorder in which the cells that normally fight infections are unable to do their job. As a result, the body becomes sensitive and prone to various forms of infections such as viral and bacterial. Secondary complications affecting the different systems of the body usually arise due to the inability of the immune system to function normally. Nezelof Syndrome is classified as a rare disease mainly affecting the immune system. This condition is strongly considered as a form of combined immunodeficiency in ICD-10 and a deficiency of cell-mediated immunity in ICD-9.

The process of breaking down fats in the body and fat utilization to support daily activities is abnormal. As a result, excessive and unhealthy amounts of lipids or fats to accumulate in the liver, bone marrow, lungs, spleen and even in the brain. Niemann-Pick disease is classified into three variants - Types A, B and C. There are two distinct bases for the variants of this disease. First is on the genetic cause and second on the symptoms being presented by the patients.
12550	Niemann-Pick disease is classified as an autosomal recessive disorder. It primarily affects the way fats or lipids are metabolized in the body. This means that the normal process of breaking down fats within the body and the manner in which they are being utilized for daily activities is impaired. This disorder severely affects the body because it can cause excessive and unhealthy buildup of lipids or fats in the liver, bone marrow, lungs, spleen and even in the brain. There are three variants of Niemann-Pick Disease which are Types A, B and C. Classification is based on the genetic cause and on the symptoms being presented.
12551	Niemann-Pick disease Type C is classified as an autosomal recessive disorder. It mainly affects the metabolism of fats and lipids in the body. The process of fat breakdown in the body and the manner of utilizing it for daily activities is greatly affected. This disorder which impairs fat metabolism in the body causes excessive and abnormally high amounts of lipids to accumulate in the liver, bone marrow, lungs, spleen and even in the brain. Niemann-Pick Disease Type C usually occurs during the childhood stages. However, it may also manifest during infancy and adulthood. Incidence for this type of disease had been estimated to be 1 in every 150,000 individuals. Niemann-Pick Disease Type C is more common among individuals of French-Acadian descent living in Nova Scotia.

12557	Nocardiosis is an infectious disease which affects the lungs or the whole body. Affectation of the lungs is termed as Pulmonary Nocardiosis while affectation of the entire body is referred to as Systemic Nocardiosis. Nocardiosis is caused primarily of an infection by bacterium of the genus Nocardia. The common forms are Nocardia asteroides and Nocardia brasiliensis. Men are more commonly affected particularly those whose immune systems are already compromised. Among patients afflicted with brain infection, rate of mortality goes beyond 80%. Among the other forms, mortality rate is at 50% even with therapy.
12558	Nocturia pertains to a condition characterized by excessive urination at night. Patients with nocturia constantly need to get up during the night to urinate and may thus suffer from sleep distortions. While it can occur in children and younger adults, nocturia more typically affects the elderly.

12561	Noise Induced Deafness may be a full or partial reduction in the ability to determine and understand sounds. This condition is usually caused by a wide range of environmental factors. Sound waves have varying frequencies and amplitudes. A person who has lost his ability to detect some frequencies and some low-amplitude sounds which should normally be detected is a characteristic of this condition. Whenever humans are exposed to harmful noise and sounds that are too loud and last a long time, the sensitive structures found in the inner ear may be damaged thereby causing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) or Noise Induced Deafness. These sensitive structures which are also called hair cells, are small sensory cells found in the inner ear. They convert sound energy into electrical signals which travel towards the brain. Once the hair cells are damaged, they cannot grow back.

There are three main sub-types of non-small cell lung cancer namely adenocarcinoma, squamous cell lung carcinoma and large cell lung carcinoma. Squamous cell lung carcinoma accounts for 31.1% of the cases. This type of non-small cell lung carcinoma usually starts in close proximity to central bronchus. Development of cavities and necrotic tissues within the center of the cancer site is a major and common finding. Squamous cell lung cancers which are well-differentiated often develop and spread at a slower pace compared to other cancer types. Adenocarcinoma accounts for 29.4% of the cases. This type usually starts in peripheral lung tissue. Majority of the cases are related to smoking. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer among non-smokers. Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma is another subtype. Women who are non-smokers are more predisposed to this cancer form and responses to treatment vary. Large cell lung carcinoma accounts for 10.7% of lung cancers. This type grows rapidly and develops near the lung surface. It is poorly differentiated most of the time and has a tendency to metastasize during its early stages.

When Raynaud's disease occurs without any underlying associated disease, it is known as primary Raynaud's (or simply, Raynaud's disease). If it appears as part of another disease, it is known as secondary Raynaud's or Raynaud's phenomenon.
13081	Razor bumps are also referred to as shaving bumps. This condition usually affects men who have very curly hairs. It occurs when the tip of the curly hair grows back towards the hair follicle. It is also known as ingrown hairs. The ingrown hair causes a skin reaction and results to razor bumps. The condition is not an infection but is considered as a reaction of a "foreign body". The condition becomes worst when the hair is pulled out while shaving, shaving in a motion against the natural direction of the hair growth, or when using a multi-blade razor.
13082	Reactive arthritis (acronym: ReA) is a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy and an autoimmune disorder that results from an infection in another part of the body. It is called "reactive" because it is caused by another infection; and "arthritis" because it presents with symptoms very similar to a range of conditions collectively called "arthritis". Other names for this condition include venereal arthritis, arthritis urethritica, and polyarteritis enterica.
13083	This disorder usually affects children which is a severe, uncommon disorder of attachment. This is distinguished by markedly disturbed and developmentally unsuitable ways of associating socially in perspective. This can condition can either be in the form of constant failure to begin or respond to social interactions.
13084	Reactive hypoglycemia is characterized by recurrent episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia that occur within 2-4 hours after ingesting a high carbohydrate meal. The condition is believed to be a consequence of excessive insulin release triggered by glucose overload that persist even after the glucose from the meal has been digested or disposed by the body. Literally, hypoglycemia is low blood sugar. Most forms of hypoglycemia occur while fasting. However, reactive hypoglycemia is one that occurs right after eating a meal.
13085	Rebound headaches are cycles of headaches. They are also referred to as medication overuse headaches.
13086	Rectal abscess pertains to an abscess buildup in the rectal area, often due to bacterial infections that produce a localized accumulation of pus. The abscess is typically located either at the opening of the rectum or further up the rectum. Rectal abscess is also used alternately with the phrase ?anal abscess?.
13087	Rectal cancer pertains to carcinoma affecting the last 6 inches of colon or large intestine, which is the lower part of the digestive system. Colon cancer and rectal cancer are sometimes collectively called colorectal cancers.
13088	Rectal inflammation is a condition in which the lining of the rectum is inflamed. It is also referred to as proctitis.
13089	Rectal itching is an itching around the anus. It is also called pruritis ani or anal itching.
13090	Rectal neoplasm is a form of colorectal cancer affecting the rectum. Because it has no early symptoms, the disease is frequently under-diagnosed. When symptoms do occur, both the symptoms and the diagnostic tests required to confirm the diagnosis are considered embarrassing by most patients. However, early diagnosis of rectal neoplasm is crucial because colorectal cancer can prove ultimately fatal.
13091	Rectal Prolapse is a medical disorder where the walls of the rectum jut out of the anus and can be seen outside the body. There are 3 main kinds of rectal prolapse: full-thickness (the entire rectum protrudes), mucosal prolapse (only the rectal mucosa protrudes), and internal intussusceptions (rectum collapses but does not protrude from the anus)
13092	Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is a condition in which a single ulcer typically occurs in the rectum that may cause rectal bleeding with straining or when having bowel movements.
13093	Rectocele is a condition in which the rectum's front wall bulges into the vagina.
13094	Rectosigmoid neoplasm is a tumor originating from the sigmoid colon or the upper rectal area. A rectosigmoid neoplasm may be benign or malignant.
13095	Rectum cancer is a kind of cancer wherein malignant cells take over the rectal tissues. In this condition the cancer cells that invade the rectal tissues cause abnormal growths in the blood vessels causing rectal obstruction. These cells can also spread in the different organs of the body.
13096	Red eye also called subconjunctival hemorrhage, is a harmless condition in which the white of the eye appears red due to a broken tiny blood vessel.
13097	Red measles, commonly known as German measles, is a short-lived contagious disease presented by red spots and inflammation of the lymph glands located behind the ears. The disease usually lasts from 14 to 21 days.
13098	Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome is a form of a chronic neurological condition commonly known as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is Type I of CRPS and does not demonstrate any distinct nerve lesions. (Conversely, Causalgia or type II CRPS presents with evident nerve damage.)
13099	Reflux esophagitis is a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) characterized by inflammatory changes in the esophageal lining caused by reflux of gastric acid into the esophagus. Esophagitis (also known as Oesophagitis) is a general term for inflammation of the esophagus. When esophagitis is caused by GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), it is known as reflux esophagitis. Reflux esophagitis commonly develops as a consequence of poor functioning of the musculature of the lower esophageal segment, which controls the reflux of the stomach's contents.
13100	Refractive errors are conditions in which the light passing through eye often loses focus. This is a cause for vision acuity. This condition is due to genetic or environmental factors, and the effects can either lead to blurry vision, astigmatism, myopia and hyperopia. The condition can be diagnosed by visual eye examination, retinoscopy and by the use of an automated refraction factor to measure the errors of eye focus. Treatment is by wearing prescription glasses, and contact lenses, as well as undergoing refractive eye surgery.
13101	Refsum disease is a group of genetic disorders called leukodystrophies where the white matter of the brain is damaged, affecting motor movements. Refsum disease usually begins in childhood or adolescence and progresses through time.
13102	Also known as Crohn's disease, regional enteritis is a chronic, episodic, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), believed to be autoimmune in origin. Regional enteritis may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus. Consequently, symptoms vary among afflicted patients.
13103	Reiter's syndrome is a medical condition characterized by three seemingly unrelated symptoms: redness of the eyes, arthritis, and urinary tract problems. It is a form of seronegative spondyloarthropathy, causing inflammation throughout the body, particularly in parts of the spine and at joints connecting the tendons and bones. Reiter's syndrome is also referred to as a form of reactive arthritis, because the resulting arthritis occurs as a reaction to an infection that started in a different part of the body.
13104	Reiters arthritis is a form of inflammatory arthritis that develops complications in the urinary tract, bowels and genital system. This kind of arthritis has two kinds: one that is sexually transmitted and another that is caused by salmonella.
13105	Relapsing fever is an infection transferred by a tick or a louse which is characterized by repeated episodes of fever. Other names for relapsing fever are tick-borne relapsing fever and louse-borne relapsing fever.
13105	Relapsing fever is a type of fever that keeps recurring. It is often joined by headaches, muscle pain, joint aches and nausea. There are two kinds: tick-borne (TBRF) and louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF).
13106	Relapsing Polychondritis is a rare and chronic condition where the cartilage of different tissues become inflamed. Part of the body affect may include the ears, the nose, windpipe, spine and joints. Because the heat, eyes and blood vessels have similar make-ups, these can also be affected.
13107	Renal agenesis is an inborn condition in which an infant is born without one or both kidneys. The absence of one kidney at birth is called unilateral renal agenesis; while the absence of both kidneys is called bilateral renal agenesis.
13108	Renal artery stenosis is a condition characterized by the narrowing of the renal artery, often as a result of atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. The narrowing of the renal artery obstructs the blood flow to the target kidney, which leads to hypertension and atrophy of the affected kidney, which in turn causes renal artery stenosis, and ultimately to renal failure if untreated.
13109	Renal Calculi, more commonly known as kidney stones, refer to crystal aggregations or solid secretions of dissolved minerals in urine. Stones or calculi often form inside the kidneys or bladder. The presence of calculi in kidneys is known as nephrolithiasis; whereas the presence of calculi in the urinary tract is known as urolithiasis.
13110	Renal cancer means cancer of the kidney; renal being the Latin word for kidney. The most common form of renal cancer is renal cell carcinoma, which starts in the renal tubule.
13111	Renal carbuncle is the medical term for abscess of the kidney, or a localized collection of pus in the kidney.
13112	Renal cell carcinoma (acronym: RCC) is the most common type of renal or kidney cancer. It starts in the renal tubule and may spread to other parts of the body if undiagnosed early.
13113	Renal colic is a painful urinary system condition commonly due to kidney stones. Colic is a misnomer since the pain in this type of disorder is chronic, not intermittent. There are 2 varieties: dull and acute.
13114	Renal dysplasia mesomelia radiohumeral fusion, also called Ulbright Hodes, is an extremely rare syndrome characterized by abnormalities in kidney development and various defects in the arm bone.
13115	Renal glycosuria is also referred to as renal glucosuria. It is a rare genetic syndrome characterized by the excretion of simple sugar glucose in the urine despite low or normal blood glucose levels. When the kidneys function normally, glucose is eliminated in the urine only when glucose in the blood is abnormally high. However, in patients with renal glycosuria, glucose is abnormally excreted in the urine as a consequence of a malfunction in the renal tubules.
13116	Renal osteodystrophy is described as a bone pathology marked by defective mineralization as a consequence of kidney disease. Renal oseodystrophy has two distinct forms, namely high bone turnover and low bone turnover.
13117	Simply put, renal tuberculosis is the kidney affected by tuberculosis. This is normally because of some haematogenous seeding from pulmonary diseases, although it is secondary to a tuberculous infection of the gastrointestinal tract or bone. By the time this condition is diagnosed, the primary laceration in the lungs might be calcified.
13118	Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by the accumulation of acid in the body as a consequence of the failure of the kidney to adequately acidify urine. The term renal tubular acidosis is attributed mostly to defective urinary acidification in otherwise well-functioning kidneys. There are different forms of renal tubular acidosis, each of which has different causes and symptoms.
13119	Repetitive strain injury (RSI) pertains to a range of conditions that result from the overuse of certain tools such as a computer, guitar, or knife, or other activities that require movement repetition. RSI commonly affects the muscles, tendons, and nerves of the hands, arms, and upper back. RSI is also alternatively known as occupational overuse syndrome, cumulative trauma disorder (CTD), or work related upper limb disorder (WRULD).
13120	Respiratory acidosis is the abnormal increase of acidity in the blood as a consequence of decreased ventilation of the pulmonary alveoli, which leads to an increase in carbon dioxide concentration (PaCO2). Respiratory acidosis can be either acute or chronic.
13121	Respiratory diphtheria pertains to an acute bacterial illness infecting the throat.
13121	Respiratory Diphtheria is an acute, toxin-mediated disease caused by virus called Corynebacterium diphtheriae. There are 2 main forms: respiratory and cutaneous. This kind of condition lasts for several days.
13122	Respiratory failure is a medical term describing the inability of the lungs to accurately and properly function. Respiratory failure can be shown by observing the oxygen (too low) and carbon dioxide (too high) levels in the blood due to a break down in gas exchange (the process of exchange between air spaces and blood in the lungs) or the movement of air in and out of the lungs.
13123	Respiratory infection is more commonly known as upper respiratory infection of (URI). This is a type of infection of the head and chest caused by a virus. The nose, throat, sinuses, ears and airways are affected. This infection usually lasts a couple of weeks.
13124	This virus causes infections in the lungs and respiratory tract. This virus commonly affects children by the age of 2 and even adults. Infection can severe especially when it infects premature babies and infants with underlying health conditions.
13125	Respiratory system cancer is a range of carcinomas commonly found in the respiratory system. Respiratory system cancer may encompass all organs involved in the breathing process, including: lung cancer, mouth cancer, oral cancer, throat cancer, tongue cancer, larynx cancer, pharynx cancer, and bronchial cancer.
13126	Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Wittmaack-Ekbom's syndrome, is a progressive neurological disease characterized by an irresistible urge to move one's body to halt odd or uncomfortable sensations. This condition usually affects the legs, but can also affect the arms and torso.
13127	Restrictive cardiomyopathy is the least usual cardiomyopathy. It is called as such due to the fact that it limits the heart from extending and filling it with blood correctly. The firm walls of the chambers of the heart prevent them from properly filling even though the rhythmicity and contractility of the heart may be regular. That is why blood flow is decreased and the blood that usually enters the heart is backed up in the circulatory system. Over time, patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy acquire heart failure.
13128	Reticuloendotheliosis is characterized by a lymphoma (or cancer that arises from the lymphocytes) of a part of the immune system known as the reticuloendothelial tissue. Leukemic reticuloendotheliosis, also known as hairy cell leukemia, is the most common type of reticuloendotheliosis. In this form of chronic leukemia, the malignant B-lymphocytes are observed in the spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. When analyzed under a microscope, the malignant cells appear to be covered with minute hair-like protrusions.
13129	Retinal degeneration refers to the deterioration of the retinal tissue. The degeneration of the retina may occur as a consequence of a number of factors, including vein or artery occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, and hereditary RLF/ROP disease, among others. Several types of progressive retinal degeneration exist in varying degrees or severities. Examples are retinoschisis, retinitis pigmentosa, lattic degeneration, and macular degeneration.
13130	Retinal detachment is an eye disorder there the retina peels away from the core layer of supporting tissue. At first, detachment may be localized, but if not treated quickly the whole retina may be detached. This can lead to loss of vision or blindness.
13131	Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) pertains to a group of genetic eye conditions characterized by progressive night blindness preceded by an extended period of tunnel vision. In retinitis pigmentosa, abnormalities of the photoreceptors or the presence of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cause progressive visual loss in affected patients.
13132	Retinoblastoma pertains to cancer of the retina that affects children. If untreated, retinoblastoma is almost invariably fatal.
13133	Retinoschisis refers to the abnormal splitting of the neurosensory layers of the retina. The splitting usually occurs in the outer plexiform layer. In rare cases, retinoschisis results in vision loss. However, in most cases, it remains asymptomatic.
13134	Retractile testicle is a condition in which the testicle glides back and forth between the scrotum and the groin.
13135	Retrograde ejaculation is release of semen into the bladder instead of through the penis during orgasm resulting in the ejaculation of very little or no semen.
13136	Also known as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), retrolental fibroplasia (RLF), is an eye disease that primarily affects prematurely born babies.
13137	Retroperitoneal fibrosis, also known as Ormond's disease, is a condition in which the fibrous tissue proliferates in the retroperitoneum, or the compartment of the body containing the renal tract, kidneys, aorta, and various other structures.
13138	Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder mostly affecting females. This disease is categorized as a pervasive development disorder by the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).
13139	Revesz Debuse syndrome is an extremely rare condition characterized mostly by anemia, retinal disease, and anomalies in the central nervous system.
13140	Reye's syndrome is a disease commonly occurring in children characterized by a range of several detrimental effects to many organs in the body, particularly the liver and the brain. If undiagnosed and untreated early, it can be potentially fatal.
13141	Reynolds syndrome is a rare disease, autoimmune in origin, characterized by scleroderma (i.e. hardened skin) and cirrhosis of the liver. This syndrome is closely associated with the combination of primary biliary cirrhosis and progressive systemic sclerosis. In some cases, Reynolds syndrome has been associated with hemolytic anemia and Sj÷gren's syndrome. Reynolds syndrome is named after Telfer B. Renolds, an American physician who first described it. Clinical presentations of Reynolds syndrome include elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood, jaundice, pruritus, and telangietasias. At the onset of Reynolds syndrome, Reynaud's phenomenon may occur as an early symptom.
13142	Rh disease, a condition affecting pregnant mothers, is one of the identified causes of hemolytic disease of the newborn (or HDN), and may range from mild to severe. In mild forms, Rh disease may cause mild anemia with reticulocytosis in the fetus. In moderate or severe forms, Rh disease can cause a more distinct anemia as well as erythroblastosis fetalis in the fetus. In its most severe form, the disease can lead to hydrops fetalis, morbus haemolyticus neonatorum, or even stillbirth. Rh disease is also alternatively called Rh (D) disease, RhD Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn, Rhesus disease, Rhesus D Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn or RhD HDN.
13143	Rhabdoid tumor pertains to a very rare and extremely aggressive tumor commonly occurring in children ages 2 to 13 years. Initially, rhabdoid tumor was believed to be a variant of Wilms' tumor. However, recent studies have shown that rhabdoid tumor is an entirely separate entity. The location of this highly malignant tumor may be intraventicular, supratentorial, or infratentorial.
13144	Rhabdomyolysis is described as the rapid breakdown (i.e. lysis) of the skeletal muscle tissue (i.e. rhabdomyo) as a consequence of a prior injury to muscle tissue.
13145	Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare form of cancer of the sarcoma (or connective tissues) commonly occurring in children ages 1 to 5 and, in some cases, teenagers ages 15 to 19. The malignant cells are believed to originate from skeletal muscle progenitors. The cancer may also attach itself to muscle tissues, wrap around intestines, or affect any other areas. The cancerous mass may resemble a 6-8 week old embryo in younger children. In teens and older children, the cancer may be as large as a 10-12 week old embryo.
13146	Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, also alternatively called sarcoma botryoides, is a rare form of vaginal cancer affecting female infants and children under 8 years old.
13147	Rhesus isoimmunisation is a condition concerning the Rhesus (Rh) factor. This is a protein found in most people's red blood cells. A person who does not have this factor is considered Rh negative, a person who does is Rh positive. An Rh negative pregnant mother exposed to blood that is Rh positive produces antibodies to the factor. This is called isoimmunization. If this happens to a mother and fetus, the antibody may cross the placenta and attach to the fetal red cells and destroyed by the fetal spleen. This condition is more commonly known as Rh isoimmunisation.
13148	Rheumatic fever pertains to an inflammatory disease which develops as a consequence of complications from a Group A streptococcal infection (e.g. scarlet fever and strep throat, etc.). Rheumatic fever commonly affects children 6 to 15 years old.
13149	Rheumatic Heart Disease pertains to a complication of rheumatic fever. This disease damages the entire heart and its membranes. It is a permanent damage to the heart due to a damaged heart valve. This disease used to be a serious form of heart disease for children and adolescents.
13150	Rheumatism, also known as rheumatic disorder, is a general term encompassing medical problems affecting the bones, kidney, joints, skin, heart, and lungs. While rheumatism is used colloquially or in a historical context, the word no longer appears in strict medical or technical literature. To date, the word "rheumatism" does not apply to a recognized disorder in modern medicine. While the term covers a wide range of medical problems, it is most commonly used in reference to fibromyalgia syndrome and/or arthritis-like symptoms. However, it is important to note that rheumatism itself is neither a recognized disease nor a distinct entity.
13151	Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, potentially disabling autoimmune disease wherein the immune system attacks the joints, causing an inflammation in the joints (i.e. arthritis) as well as in other parts of the body (commonly in the lungs and the skin).
13152	Rheumatoid spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis. It is also referred to as ankylosing spondylitis or spondylitis.
13153	Rhinitis is a condition describing the irritation and swelling of the inner part of the nose. This condition is also seen to affect the throat, eyes and ears. It is also associated with sleeping problems. Rhinitis can also be triggered by an allergy. There are two types: allergic and no-allergic rhinitis.
13154	Hay fever is a condition resulting from an allergic reaction to indoor or outdoor airborne allergens, such as dust mites, pollen, or pet dander.
13155	Rhinophyma is a medical condition identified by an overgrowth of the sebaceous glands of the nose. It is part of a skin disorder called rosacea. In women, sensitive capillaries result in flushing and dilated small red veins made visible on the surface of the skin.
13156	Rhupus is a disease characterized by rheumatism and lupus. It is a rare condition in which the hands of an affected person become deformed due to the growth of cysts and calcification of the cartilage. The main symptoms of this illness are numbness and immobility of the affected area. Treatment for the rhupus requires surgery.
13157	Rib-gap syndrome, also known as cerebrocostomandibular syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that features an abnormally small jaw, deformed upper jaw, a refracted tongue, and rib dysplasia. These deformities usually lead to respiratory problems as well as moderate to severe mental retardation.
13158	Rib cage inflammation, also known as costochondritis, is the swelling of the ribs due to injuries and other abnormalities experienced by the chest.
13159	Riboflavin deficiency pertains to a lack of Riboflavin, which is another name for vitamin B2. This disorder occurs when the patient does not have sufficient amount of vitamin B2 in the body. This deficiency is also known as ariboflavinosis.
13160	Richter syndrome is an extremely rare disease characterized by the transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) into a rapidly progressive form of lymphoma. Also known as Richter transformation, this disorder is a type of high grade non Hodgkin's lymphoma affecting patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. To date, only 1 in 20 documented cases of CLL leads to Richter syndrome.

13162	Rickets is a disease characterized by the softening of the bones in children, which can potentially lead to fractures and deformity. Although rickets can affect adults, most documented cases are those of malnourished or undernourished children living in developing countries.
13163	Rickettsial diseases refer to a group of disorders caused by Rickettsiae, a type of microorganism that can be a cross between virus and bacteria. Rickettsiae can only survive inside cells and cause disease by damaging the blood vessels in various organs and tissues. In severe cases, multiple organs and/or tissues may be affected. Rickettsial diseases vary in extent and severity, ranging from mild conditions to potentially fatal infections. Because they can be life-threatening, afflicted patients must seek emergency treatment or urgent medical care if Rickettsial diseases are suspected.
13164	Rickettsialpox is a disease commonly presented by fever, lethargy, headache, skin rashes, and damage to the blood vessels. The disease is caused parasitic arthropods that thrive in the body causing ruptures in the lymph nodes. Rickettsialpox can be detected by serological tests and can be treated by tetracycline.
13165	Rickettsiosis is a bacterial infection caused by microorganisms belonging to the order Rickettsiales. Types of Rickettsiosis vary in terms of degree and severity. The most common examples are Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Rickettsialpox, and typhus, among others. Rickettsiae, the organisms that cause Rickettsiosis, can only survive and multiply intracellularly. They were first discovered in 1909 by Howard Ricketts, an American Researcher.

13167	Right heart failure is an alternate name for this condition is congestive heart failure - right-sided. It is defined by the failure of the right side of the heart ventricle loses its ability to pump blood efficiently. This disorder is caused when the right ventricle does not function properly and the blood backs up into other areas of the body causing congestion.
13168	Riley-Day syndrome, more commonly known as familiar dysautonomia (FD), is characterized by a disorder of the autonomic nervous system. Riley-Day syndrome commonly affects the survival and development of sympathetic, (some) parasympathetic, and sensory neurons of the autonomic and sensory nervous system.
13169	Ringworm, also called Tinea, pertains to a skin infection characterized by a reddish or brownish bumpy patch of skin that's usually lighter at the center, thus resembling a ring-like appearance. Ringworms can exist in any part of the body.
13170	Ringworm of the body is a fungal infection affecting the top layer of the skin. It is also referred to as tinea corporis.
13171	Ringworm of the scalp is a fungal infection affecting the scalp, skin, and nails. It is also known as tinea capitis.
13172	The medical term for this condition is Onchocerciasis which is the world's second most leading infectious cause of blindness. Basically it is a skin and eye infection which is caused by the helmith (worm) Onchocerca volvulus. The black fly that carries the worm is only seen in parts of Africa, South America and Middle East.
13173	Robinow syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder defined by vertebral segmentation, short-limbed-dwarfism, as well as distinct abnormalities in the face, head, and external genitalia. Robinow syndrome has two known forms, dominant and recessive. The dominant form is most common and present with moderate manifestations of known symptoms. Recessive Robinow, on the other hand, presents with more distinct skeletal abnormalities. Robinow syndrome is also alternatively called Robinow dwarfism, Robinow-Silverman-Smith syndrome, fetal face syndrome, fetal facies syndrome, mesomelic dwarfism-small genitalia syndrome, or acral dysostosis with facial and genital abnormalities.
13174	Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the most severe form of rickettsial illness. It is most frequently reported in the USA, but has also been known to occur in Central and South America.
13175	Also known as nemaline myopathy and nemaline rod myopathy, rod myopathy pertains to a congenital, hereditary neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive and non-progressive muscle weakness of varying severity. Rod myopathy is clinically classified into several groups, ranging from mild (typical), intermediate, severe, to adult-onset. However, this categorization is somewhat ambiguous, with categories commonly overlapping.
13176	Rodent ulcer is a type of cancer of the skin accounting for about 75% of all skin cancers. This is a slow-growing skin tumor in the basal skin cells. The cancer cells that cause ulcers gradually enlarge gnawing at the normal cells, thus the name rodent ulcer.
13177	Romano-Ward syndrome is a major variant of a heart condition known as long QT syndrome, a condition that causes the cardiac muscle to take abnormally longer to recharge between beats. Romano-Ward syndrome is characterized by a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm.
13178	This condition is very common but oftentimes misunderstood which commonly affects women. The condition starts as erythema (redness or flushing) on the center of the face and across the cheeks, nose or forehead. This condition is sometimes confused and co-exist with acne vulgaris and/or seborrheic dermatitis.
13179	Rosai-Dorfman disease pertains to a rare, benign condition characterized by an excess in the production of histiocytes, which build up in the lymph nodes throughout the body. The elevated histiocytes typically accumulate in the lymphadenopathy of the neck. In addition, histiocytes may also build up outside the lymph nodes, particularly in the skin, bone, and upper respiratory tract. Rosai-Dorfman disease presents with a variety of symptoms depending on the site or area of histiocyte accumulation.
13180	Roseola infantum is a benign disease affecting children, commonly under two years old, characterized by a temporary rash that occurs following a fever that lasts for three days. Roseola infantum is more commonly known as exanthem subitum, which literally means "sudden rash". Other names for the disease are sixth disease (because it is the sixth condition to cause rashes in children), baby measles (a more confusing name), and three day fever. The origin of roseola infantum was unknown for a long time. Recently, however, research findings have revealed that the disease is caused by two human herpesviruses, namely HHV-7 (Roseolovirus) and HHV-6 (Human Herpesvirus Six).
13181	The Ross river virus is referred to as the arbovirus of the genus Alphavirus. Infections in humans are caused by an epidemic polyarthritis which is commonly known as Ross River Fever. In the years 1995-2004, it infected an average of about 4,000 people annually in Australia. The virus is widespread to the parts of Australia and Papua New Guinea and was later observed in an outburst in the South Pacific in the years 1979-1980. The infection happens most on adults and rarely affects children.
13182	Rotator cuff injury involves any type of irritation or damage to the rotator cuff muscles or tendons.
13183	Rotavirus is an infection of a member of the Reoviridae family, it is a genus of double-stranded RNA virus. Ratovirus has 7 species simply named, A, B, C, D, E, F and G, the most common being Ratovirus A. This virus causes severe diarrhea among infants and toddlers.
13184	Rotor syndrome is a rare bilirubin disorder inherited via the autosomal recessive trait. Named after Arturo Belleza Rotor, a Filipino internist, Rotor syndrome is a relatively benign disease that starts soon after birth or during early childhood.
13185	Also known as German measles, Rubella pertains to a relatively common childhood infection which literally means "little red" in Latin. While it is more common in children, it also affects adults. Affected adults recover more slowly than children.
13186	Congenital rubella syndrome (or CRS) can affect a developing fetus of a pregnant woman who has been infected by rubella during the first trimester of her pregnancy. If the mother is infected 0-28 days before conception, there is a 43% risk of the fetus being affected. If infection occurs 0-12 days after conception, chances of CRS affecting the infant are 51%. If the infection occurs 13-26 weeks after conception, the chances of CRS affecting the fetus are 23%. However, if the infection occurs in the last trimester, specifically in the 26th to 20th week after conception, the infants are not generally affected.
13187	Rubeola, more commonly known as measles, is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus and spread through respiration.
13188	Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, also called Broad Thumb-Hallux syndrome, is a condition characterized by moderate to severe mental retardation, short stature, broad thumbs and first toes, distinctive facial features, and short stature. A distinction can be made between Rubinstein-Taybi like syndrome and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome; the latter has gene promoter involvement.
13189	Rumination disorder is a type of eating disorder in which the affected patient brings up partially digested food, and then chews it again before either swallowing or spitting it out. Originally named "childhood rumination disorder", this chronic condition commonly affects children 3 to 12 months of age and may cause malnutrition. But while rumination primarily occurs in infancy or childhood, it may also affect adults. In some animals known as ruminants, rumination is a normal part of digestion. However, in humans, this behavior is distinctly abnormal and can be potentially dangerous because the esophagus can be damaged by frequent exposure to stomach acids. Rumination is linked to other eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, and is believed to be related to the sufferer's apprehension or stress after eating a normal meal. For individuals with bulimia or purging compulsions, rumination may occur when the patient is unable to throw up. To date, there is no known cure or case for rumination. In some cases, the patients may simply "grow out of it" (or outgrow the condition), but there is no guarantee the affected patients will do so.
